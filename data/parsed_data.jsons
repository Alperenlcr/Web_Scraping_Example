Ali Sabry, at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September, 2022 \u2013 New York.", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nMr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General, Excellencies,\nLadies & Gentlemen,\nI am honoured to represent Sri Lanka at the 77th session of the UNGA; a session which, after two years, brings together world leaders post pandemic to an Assembly in person.\n\nMay I also convey our appreciation to His Excellency Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives for his excellent stewardship of the 76th Session. As a close friend and neighbour of the Maldives, we express particular appreciation for his Presidency of Hope that gave us renewed optimism and vigour. Building on this, we move to the vision of our new President of the Genereal Assembly (PGA) of finding solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science.\nMr. President,\nSeventy seven years ago, when the battlefield of the Second World War was silent but its horrors revaberated around the globe, a new world order emerged out of the remains of the older one. And that new world order was manifested by the Charter of the United Nations, developed by 50 nations at the San Francisco Conference. The United Nations is a table where every State can sit down, a forum where everyone can be heard and where everyone is equally important. This is the concept of multilateralism, and this is a fundamental political principle of diplomacy. It is said that multilateral diplomacy is similar to gardening; you plant, you wait, you sow the seeds, you wait, you trim and harvest at some point. In multilateralism, we talk to each other, we develop a relationship of trust and confidence and if something was to come up, you have the base to work from.\nExcellencies,\n\nIt is not difficult to imagine that these trends lead to deepening inequalities, both within and between States. Developing countries and their economies are at extreme risk with Governments facing debt-default and financial collapse due to lack of access to adequate capital, while people face rising poverty, unemployment and hunger. As a consequence, nutrition levels especially among children are being affected and their education and intellectual advancement disrupted. Despite our best efforts, our collective ability to realize the Sustainable Development Goals or even to sustain the gains already achieved is becoming increasingly difficult.\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President, we are committed to that process.\nIt is envisaged that through the proposed legislative and constitutional amendments, democratic governance will be reinforced with independent oversight institutions as well as with enhanced public scrutiny. Legal and administrative frameworks are being strengthened to ensure transparency, integrity, accountability and inclusivity in providing access to justice. A greater participation of women and youth will be ensured in this process.\nMr. President,\nWe remain cognizant of and acutely sensitive to the events that have taken place in the recent past. The Government is extremely sensitive to the socio- economic hardships faced by our people. We are pleased to have reached a staff level understanding with the IMF. We have put in place measures to protect the vulnerable segments of society and will endeavor to ensure that these economic reforms will have a minimum impact on their lives. Our institutions and society have demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of very difficult circumstances.\n\nMr. President,\n\nMr. President,\n\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President,\nLet me say a word about global security. Geopolitical tensions among nations have heightened, creating insecurity and polarization among States. Agreed frameworks for arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament have become fragile. At the 10th Review Conference of the NPT concluded recently, which remains the centerpiece of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, we were regrettably unable to arrive once again at a consensus outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\nMr. President,\n\nMr. President,\n\nMr. President,\nIt is indeed a watershed moment for the international community: a moment of great challenge and opportunity. The complex and interconnected crises that we face cannot be resolved by nations acting on their own. It is an opportunity to demonstrate global solidarity, diplomacy and collective efforts, leveraging the ideas and talents of all of our people and all segments of our society to find transformative solutions which leave no one behind. Multilateralism, Mr. President, is a tool for diplomacy that rises above such challenges. Conflicts, disasters and crises will not stop at passport control. Multilateralism is not without its shortcomings, and undoubtedly it provides a solid framework for resolving contemporary challenges.\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President,\nPermit me to make the observation that the 193 nations represented here jointly share the responsibility to establish justice, to maintain peace and ensure progress in a world that is in trouble as never before. We have a Charter and a formidable body of international law inclusive of our supreme law of the Constitution of the Republic and other local statutes. We are acutely conscious of the fact that notwithstanding all these sophistications, multipronged challenges remain. The Government of Sri Lanka is commited to overcoming these challenges.\nIt is to that commitment that Sri Lanka pledges today, in the sincere hope that we will exploit the crisis that is at hand, build back better, leaving no one behind and rise to new horizons of freedom and progress.\n\n\n..................................................\n\n..................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Statement can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/ZU-BRdq106c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Statement can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/ZU-BRdq106c\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "00852d38c1203b64a6e0ceeeb7bb4276"}

{"title": "Foreign Secretary appeals to Overseas Sri Lankans to rethink plans to be repatriated unless in compelling circumstances", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nPriority right now of the Government following the Cabinet Paper presented by my Minister Dinesh Gunawardena two weeks ago, is to bring back the migrant worker category which needs to come, but more so in some cases have to come. Because they have gone out of status and are illegal, they also as a result of being illegal do not have access to the health facilities and anything else in those countries. There are many who have been thrown out of jobs. They are pretty much destitute. Thereafter we can consider those who want to come, but who have jobs and who simply want to come on holiday to avoid any Corona vulnerability.\nOur plea to these employees, as we did to students some time ago, is to ask them to carefully calibrate the possible loss of jobs or loss of educational opportunity or major delays which can occur from their coming. Because in students, we particularly find that in some places, one set of parents want children to come, another set of parents want children to stay and finish their exams. So, while I know these are personal choices alright, I think there must be some rationality in doing this. Because from the Foreign Ministry perspectives, we are working very hard to get them back today, but I know that one month, two months from now, we will once again be asked to try to reconcile their status as students, when there are difficulties for them to get back or lose out on semester. It is the same with those who lose their employment.\nSo as much as the Foreign Ministry and the Government is trying to bring back people, that these people who are wanting to return, make a very careful assessment of their essential needs, as against just wanting to come for the short term. This may not be the best time to use this limited window and have to go into quarantine for 21 days when they come here as well.\nWe are going to try as much as possible to ensure that those who stay back are assisted to the extent possible, particularly the most vulnerable through the various networks of our 67 Missions, 16 where SLBFE is also present, to try and provide dry rations and where necessary medicines so that the problems they face are managed out there where they are.\nAs for those on short term visits, we have to bring them back. They have nowhere to go. We are conscious of that. The difficulty to some extent is the fact that they are spread all over and Sri Lankan Airlines, even cargo flights which now are flying, are not flying out to many of these capitals. So, while we are integrating them in flights already coming, how we bring them all back is a matter which is at the moment being discussed at the highest levels.\nMinistry of Foreign Relations\nColombo\n\n17 May 2020\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "00df4234ebde3e35a162f4802f1ce00f"}

Following the neutralization of this group in 2009, the Government of Sri Lanka undertook the substantial task of rehabilitating these children and reuniting them with their families. I would now like to show a few photos that depict the rehabilitation programme conducted by Sri Lanka for the ex-child soldiers, where we treated these children like our own children and apart from the formal education, they had the opportunity to attend scouting programmes and even some radio programmes at a media institution.\nI must refer to the mandates and early warning chapters in the Vancouver Principles which opens up a wide window of scenarios. We cannot be heard to turn a blind eye to some of the activities of these non-state actors who as we speak are engaged in the very activity which we are seeking to stop. I will briefly show you some photographs which depict the use of child soldiers and is being used to promote the idea of hate and terror. In one picture, as you see children dressed in combat uniforms carrying replicas of rocket launchers missiles and guns. This is a lovely play! This is not Cinderella or Jack & the Bean Stalk or Little Red Riding Hood but promoting hate, little children carrying replicas of bazoocas and all kinds of weapons. In the other, school children as young as 8 years is enacting a drama dressed as suicide soldiers. Here is another one of glorification of child soldiers, in another little skit.

The unit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka does not condone or tolerate any form of torture, and seeks to work with all, including bilateral partners, as well as international organisations, to seek their assistance in terms of sharing experiences and expertise, as well as technical support, to ensure the elimination of this despicable practice and prosecute anyone responsible.\n\nYours sincerely,\nPrasad Kariyawasam\nSecretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/11/08/world/asia/ap-as-sri-lanka-torture.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "10a9ea665f543a8faa063d960564b2b7"}

The relations between our peoples go back to mid 1800s, pre-dating the formal establishment of diplomatic relations. Over the years, this engagement has significantly matured into a multifaceted relationship, covering political, economic, educational, cultural and defence spheres including maritime matters. Equally important, the People to People interactions between our two nations.\nIn this context, it gives me immense pleasure in extending to you, my esteemed counterpart from the United States, Hon. Michael Pompeo, warm and cordial welcome to Sri Lanka. The fact that you have chosen to visit Sri Lanka, despite formidable challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic; dedicating your time and sharing your insight; is heart-warming Excellency.\nYour wide-ranging discussions with His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and our own discussions have generated a renewed momentum to the conversations with key American interlocutors have had with Sri Lankan leaders over the past months this year.\n\n\n\n\nThe US has been a friend and assisting Sri Lanka in times of difficulty and we remain deeply grateful for your support. US assistance to Sri Lanka after the Asian Tsunami in 2004 was significant. I recall the visits of former President George Bush (Senior) and former President Bill Clinton; the assistance in the aftermath of Easter-Sunday terrorists attacks in April 2019; and, most recently for COVID-19 mitigation. Especially, I also extend my sincere thanks and appreciation once again for proscribing the LTTE terrorist organization even before the 9/11 attacks and up to now.\n\n\nIt was also considered opportune to broaden our bilateral engagement in areas such as ICT, Cyber Security, Agriculture, Science, Technology, Innovations, Trade, Investment, Business and Climate Change.\n\n\nFinally, let me wish Secretary Pompeo and Mrs. Pompeo who is joining him on this visit, a very pleasant stay in Sri Lanka and safe travel in Asia in the next few days.\nOn behalf of the People of Sri Lanka I wish you AYU-BOWAN\nAnd I give the floor to Secretary of State, Hon.

{"title": "44th Session of the Human Rights Council  Agenda Item 2: Interactive dialogue on the annual report of the High Commissioner 02 July 2020", "date": "date", "content": "\nStatement by Sri Lanka\nMadam President,\nSri Lanka welcomes the presentation by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Annual Report of her Office for 2019.We appreciate the initiatives taken by the Office to provide technical and financial assistance to States upon request, and highlight the need for equitable geographical representation in the Office. In continuation of our commitment to constructive engagement, Sri Lanka will be making a voluntary contribution of USD 5000 to the Office of the High Commissioner in 2020.\n\nAs a country that has guaranteed free universal healthcare to all its people since 1953, through one of the highest per capita health expenditures in its region, Sri Lanka has been able to successfully contain the spread of COVID-19 through a balanced, multi-sectoral approach.\nSwift preventive measures at the national level, a well-networked, multi-stakeholder contact tracing mechanism, and a robust healthcare system geared towards screening / testing and hospitalized care, have helped to ensure zero social transmission of COVID-19 in the country since 1 May 2020. With only 11 deaths, the last being on 01 June 2020, the COVID-19 fatality rate in Sri Lanka stands at 0.54%, which is significantly lower than the global fatality rate of 4.85%, while the recovery rate in Sri Lanka stands at 83.59% higher than the global recovery rate of 54.77%.[1]\nMadam President,\nThe approach adopted by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) in containing the pandemic, which has also been commended by the World Health Organisation, has been inclusive, non-discriminatory and holistic, providing foremost importance to safeguarding the health and safety of not only its people but foreign nationals in its territory.\nThe steps taken by the Government to curb the spread of the virus did not at any point involve resort to emergency measures that would have required derogations from the exercise of fundamental freedoms, but were strictly limited to minimum temporary restrictions on movement in the interest of public health, in accordance with the due process of law, with the aim of protecting right across the country all sections of society during this pandemic, which too were fully lifted on 28 June 2020.\nThese public health measures were accompanied by a series of policies aimed at advancing the economic and social rights of particularly the vulnerable segments in society, such as support for low income families, older persons, the differently-abled, day income earners, farmers and industries, with a view to building their resilience to the effects of the pandemic.\nIn this regard, we recall the address by the President of Sri Lanka to the Summit of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) on 4 May 2020, where the attention of world leaders was drawn to the unprecedented economic and debt-related challenges arising from COVID-19, and the consequent need for debt relief and financial stimulus for developing countries. We appreciate that the High Commissioner has also highlighted this need in her update by calling for debt relief and direct investments to fulfil the right to development in the post-pandemic world.\nAt the regional level, Sri Lanka has contributed USD 5 million to the COVID-19 Emergency Fund of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to assist pandemic related challenges in the region.\nMadam President,\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic moves from one geographical region in the world to another, we are increasingly reminded of the stark inequalities that exist in our global landscape, which are often exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic. The United Nations system, including this Council, has a pivotal role in addressing these inequalities and in ensuring that no one is actually left behind in global efforts to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. Sri Lanka believes that genuine dialogue and cooperation among the international community is important to achieve this objective and we stand ready to share its experience and good practices with fellow nations and work in solidarity with them towards this end.\nMadam President,\n\nIn conclusion, the Government of Sri Lanka continues its engagement with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Human Rights mechanisms and work in close cooperation with the international community through capacity building and technical assistance in mutually agreed areas, in keeping with domestic priorities and policies.\nThank you.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "188b8deb6f31318681a8c8ae0f75accb"}

This enriching interaction with the Muslim community of Sri Lanka extends to the most cordial relations Sri Lanka enjoys with the Islamic states of the international community.\nThe Minister stated that Sri Lanka will continue to uphold its rich democratic tradition as a society where every person irrespective of their religion, ethnicity or race enjoys the freedom to express their identity by practising their own religion, culture and language. This is also reflected in the rich and varied legal tradition of Sri Lanka which includes personal laws specific to Muslim, Kandyan and Tamil communities, which Sri Lanka will continue to retain. In recent years, as in other parts of the world, fringe groups of extremists in the name of various faiths have tried to disrupt this social harmony and create confusion in our society, including through the misuse of modern communication technology and ungoverned access to social media. The Minister also explained to the Islamic envoys the legislative steps currently underway to curb such hate speech.\nThe envoys present agreed that diversity of religion and culture was a strength to Sri Lanka and expressed confidence in the measures taken by the government to clarify ambiguities spread by extreme elements, as well as other recent progressive step relevant to the Muslim community. They expressed their solidarity with Sri Lanka in these efforts as well as their cooperation in overcoming the challenges related to economic recovery and progress.\nThe Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister thanked the envoys for the open and constructive discussion, and for their goodwill towards Sri Lanka.\n\nForeign Ministry\nColombo\n02 December, 2021\n\n...................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "2086b40792c630bb92b111aca15704d6"}

{"title": "Sri Lanka underscores the importance of health of citizens in a successful democracy at the 13th Bali Democracy Forum in Jakarta", "date": "date", "content": "\n\n\nWhile commending the initiative taken by Indonesia to organize the Forum, the State Minister thanked the Government of Indonesia for their commitment to contribute both individually and collectively to the common purpose of collaborating in upholding democracy for the Asia Pacific region.\nThe State Minister further noted that Sri Lanka adopted a balanced, multi-sectoral approach to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and held its commitment to the democratic processes, and conducted Parliamentary elections successfully and peacefully in August 2020. Sri Lanka believes that health of the citizens of a state is a strong pillar in inclusive democracies. Hence, the State Minister reiterated that BDF has a genuine objective to build a dialogue and cooperation among the international community. Sri Lanka further assured its support to share its experience and good practices with fellow nations and work in solidarity with them towards this end.\nThe discussions at the BDF focused on the challenges ahead of democracy, recession and growing skepticism and the need to focus on multifarious aspects within a crisis and ways to maintain resilience during crises and in turn contributing towards a stable democracy and justice within society.\nThe BDF was established in 2008, to create a progressive diplomatic architecture in the Asia Pacific region which has now developed as an annual Asia-Pacific Forum. In the past decade, the Forum facilitated democracy through sharing experience, while managing diversity, encouraging equality, mutual understanding and respect. This year BDF was inaugurated by President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Retno L.P. Marsudi with the participation of 33 countries around the world and 10 Ministerial level participants at the Forum.\nForeign Ministry\nColombo\n10 December 2020\n..........................................\n\nHonourable Chair, Distinguished Delegates\nAt the outset, permit me to congratulate the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and its Foreign Ministry for convening this virtual 13th Bali Democracy Forum which will deliberate this very pressing global issue. Efforts by Indonesia to organize this event, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, amply demonstrates its commitment to upholding democracy in collaboration with its partners in the Asia Pacific region. I am convinced that the outcome of these deliberations will continue to promote dialogue on this important topic.\nThe impacts of the pandemic have been multi-faceted, creating an economic, social and healthcare crisis of global proportions.\nSri Lanka has not been spared from the impacts of this pandemic. While adopting recommendations of the WHO and local health authorities to contain this virus, the primary focus of the Government of Sri Lanka has been to ensure the preservation of life and the well-being of its citizens; particularly those who may be most vulnerable to the impacts of this pandemic.\n\nSri Lanka has also made this crisis an opportunity to invest in the healthcare system so as to manage this pandemic, and prepare ourselves to face any such health crises in the future.\nBeyond the health implications of this pandemic, it is clear that the economic fallout of this crisis needs urgent attention both in the short and long term. This is particularly the case for developing countries in the Asia Pacific.\nTo ensure that the most vulnerable in our communities are protected and their futures secured, the Government of Sri Lanka has enacted multiple policies aimed at advancing their economic and social rights. This includes support for low-income families, the elderly, differently-abled persons, daily wage earners, farmers and those that are stakeholders in Small and Medium Enterprise to build their resilience to the oncoming challenges.\nDistinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentleman,\nDemocracy remains a tried and tested system that provides the ideal formula for nations to progress. It is well known that it is within a strong democracy that peace, prosperity, and human welfare thrives. It is important to remember that the successful application of democratic principles during these trying times will depend on them flourishing during normal times.\nIn the current context of what can only be termed as an unprecedented period, the pressures on healthcare, personal freedoms, education, employment and trade among countless others, is severe.\nAs countries grapple with the health and economic implications of this crisis, the fundamentals principles of democracy including the freedom of movement, association may be inadvertently compromised for the greater good of the society. It is in times like these, that we as democratic nations must remember that these restrictions are temporary, and stand for the democratic principles that have held us in good stead so far.\n\nWith positive news surrounding breakthroughs in vaccine development the world looks on in hope that a return to normalcy may be on the horizon.\nBeing nations that value cooperation and partnership, particularly at the regional level, as exemplified by this forum, it is vital that we prevent any potential inequalities as nations seek access to vaccines. These vaccines must be available and affordable. Therefore, we must ensure that a coordinated approach is adopted so that all countries receive this vital vaccine and that no-one is left behind.\nBy doing so, we will be protecting lives and the true essence of democracy, a system that should work for all of, not some of us.\nI thank you.\nThe full video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/5nd9t5svSzk\n.....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.........................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/5nd9t5svSzk\n.........................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...........................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/5nd9t5svSzk\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "266bc166aceb3a069833db82d44c669e"}

{"title": "MEDIA STATEMENT BY THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS", "date": "date", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister Peiris elaborated on a series of concerns pertaining to the questionable process of the OISL and matters relating to its integrity and transparency. He stated that on 1st August 2014, the OISL had made a formal public announcement, including on its website, that submissions by individuals, organisations and governments must be made by midnight Geneva time on 30thOctober 2014 and had given explicit reasons for the imposition of such a deadline. However, to his surprise, on 2nd November 2014, the OHCHR Spokesperson, in response to a question raised by a Sri Lankan newspaper, had stated that while officially, the deadline for submissions was 30thOctober, which will not be extended, since they are aware that some material may take time to arrive, late submissions would not necessarily be refused. He commented that it is interesting to note that such a position was revealed unofficially soon after the request from Ananthi Sasitharan, a member of the Northern Provincial Council, addressed to the three experts of the OISL, for an extension of the period for submissions. While stating that it is perfectly acceptable to extend a deadline openly, to do so in a clandestine manner, so as to benefit selectively a group of persons expressing a particular point of view, the Minister stressed, is unacceptable and expressed shock at the unprofessional conduct demonstrated by these developments.\nMinister Peiris further explained that although the Programme Budget Implications of the Resolution 25/1 make provision for staff of the OISL to travel to Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and North America to access alleged victims and witnesses living outside the country, the OISL has not revealed details of dates and venues where such hearings are to take place. The Minister disclosed that the OHCHR has indicated that such information is confidential and regretted that this process is shrouded in impenetrable secrecy. The failure to share such information makes it evident that the investigation is not freely accessible to the public, he said. The Minister added that the impression created by such action is that the OISL will make arrangements to only interact with persons of their choosing which will provide them access to information of the nature that they wish to receive.\nExternal Affairs Minister Peiris expressed strong displeasure at the selective and biased approach followed where the investigation determines the nature of the information they wish to receive, for a specific outcome. Prof. Peiris stressed that this flawed procedure infringes on the basic norms of justice and fairplay. He said that though Sri Lanka has rejected the UNHRC Resolution establishing an international investigation, it was only reasonable for the international community to expect, as the minimum requirement,that the investigation would follow certain fundamental principles relating to objectivity and fairness.\nProfessor Peiris observed, in conclusion, that the Government of Sri Lanka will do everything in its power to protect the national interest in this situation.\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "26ed83cea4563264aa3564e9869f9d02"}

{"title": "\u200bStatement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka at the 50th Regular Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on 13 June 2022", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nMr. President,\nSri Lanka has regularly shared our progress and challenges in an open exchange with this Council and other organs of the United Nations. It is in this spirit of transparency, candour and openness that I make this address to the current session of the Council.\nThe international community is aware of the grave social and economic situation that Sri Lanka has been faced with in recent weeks. While this situation has been aggravated by ongoing global crises including the pandemic, the focus of the protests has consisted of demands for economic relief and institutional reform. In recognition of these challenges and in moving forward in an inclusive manner, we consider it crucial to heed the aspirations of all segments of our people, in particular, the youth.\nMr. President,\nAs a stable foundation for the future, the President and the Prime Minister have called for a consensual approach to national issues through a broad-based government. Far reaching political changes are already taking place with the appointment of a new Prime Minister and of a new multi-party Cabinet.\nWe are actively engaged in evolving an all-party consensus regarding the need for the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, to consolidate seminal democratic values enshrined in Parliament, independent institutions and salutary checks and balances on the powers of the Executive. We need to ensure collectively that these reforms take place within a democratic constitutional framework and in keeping with due process. The process of change must not destroy the very democratic institutions that are sought to be strengthened.\n\nMr. President,\nOn the important aspect of the economy, in order to stabilize the situation and provide essentials for our people, we are formulating concrete measures which are expected to lead to an IMF supported programme. In moving forward, we are in dialogue with all stakeholders including domestic and international partners. We are putting together a coherent structure to place our economy back on a sustainable growth path and to provide for necessities such as food, fertilizer, energy and medicines. The current situation and future reform measures have a potentially adverse impact on the lives and livelihoods of the poor and the vulnerable. In agreement, therefore, with the emphatic remarks by the distinguished High Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, earlier this morning, Sri Lanka is firmly committed to targeted social protection measures to mitigate these consequences. We certainly recognize, as a core belief, that human rights are indivisible, interconnected and interdependent.\nMr. President,\nOver the past years, including at the 49th Session in March this year, we have interacted with the Council in addressing a series of issues raised in relation to Sri Lanka. Today, as we seek to redress grievances and issues in a broader social context, it is both compelling and challenging to demonstrate further tangible progress on post-conflict consolidation through domestic processes. We will continue to do so by active engagement with this Council.\nNotwithstanding the recent challenges and constraints, I would like to highlight significant progress made in some key areas.\nSince the previous meeting, soon after my pledge to the HRC that the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) will be amended, I presented legislation to Parliament to amend the PTA, and this was enacted. The cumulative effect of these Amendments will make a substantial improvement of, and a profound impact upon, the existing law and will further the cause of human rights and human freedoms in Sri Lanka. In this regard, the Inspector General of Police has issued instructions whereby there is a de facto moratorium on arrests being made under the PTA. Law enforcement officials have been instructed to follow due process in the conduct of investigations under the PTA and to use this legislation only in instances of extreme necessity.\nAfter the last Session of this Council, from March to June 2022, 22 persons detained under the PTA have been released on the recommendation of the Advisory Board established under Section 13 of the PTA.\n\nThe Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) continued with its mandate in promoting reconciliation.\n\n\nMore than 92% of private lands occupied by the military at the end of the conflict has been released to the legitimate owners. Steps are being taken to resettle the last remaining 8,090 IDPs.\nOn the Easter Sunday attacks, the Attorney General has sent out several indictments to High Courts and the Trials in this regard are proceeding.\nSri Lanka remains, at the same time, open to engaging with the diaspora community and with civil society organizations committed to the wellbeing of our country.\nMr. President,\nIn the past I have made clear that Sri Lanka rejects the so-called external evidence gathering mechanism introduced by HRC Resolution 46/1, adopted without our consent and that of other members of this Council. We reiterate our conviction that this mechanism will only serve to polarize and divide, and will be an unproductive and unhelpful drain on the resources of this Council and its Members.\nIn conclusion, we seek the understanding of this Council regarding the challenging social and economic situation in Sri Lanka. We undertake to engage in the multiple tasks before us and to honour legitimate commitments. Sri Lanka is an active participant in the multilateral framework and has continued its close engagement with the international community and the Human Rights Council to realize the promotion and protection of human rights with justice and equity for our people. The difficult situation we are facing today and the voices of our youth remind us urgently that we need to address these challenges with humility.\nOur approach, Mr. President, is to recognize the challenge without being overwhelmed or constricted by it. With a clearly conceived objective, clarity regarding the means to accomplish it and, above all, confidence in the resilience of our people - which has served this nation well in the past - we embark on an intricate journey, step by step. We are immensely fortified by the sustained goodwill and support of the international community, manifested in abundant measure, and look forward to continuing open engagement.\nI thank you Mr. President.\n...................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "27d47d4e11153ae692c589d34f5bcaf2"}

I am glad that new opportunities have opened up now as a result of the changes that are taking place in Sri Lanka, to renew our political, economic and cultural ties.\n\n\nGermany and Sri Lanka have had diplomatic relations for 62 years.\nGermany has stood by Sri Lanka throughout and assisted our people in many different ways.\n\nI am happy that we are able to now intensify cooperation between Sri Lanka and Germany that will help cement our strong ties further.\nSri Lanka has long been a paradise for German tourists, and we want to make every effort to now make Sri Lanka a paradise for German investors.\nWith relatively well developed infrastructure and human capital, our immediate priority is to reset the investment climate by making Sri Lanka a secure, efficient and competitive investment destination in South Asia.\nWe have re-established the independence of the judiciary and we are in the process of creating a rule based system where all companies will enjoy a level-playing field.\nWe are making our economy more efficient through smarter regulations.

During the period under review - from 2017 to 2022 - Sri Lanka faced unprecedented challenges including the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of the war in Ukraine that culminated in serious economic and social challenges for the country. During my recent interventions in Geneva, I have highlighted that it is no exaggeration to conclude that the year 2022 was our most challenging period in recent times.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\nWe are determined to strengthen ethnic harmony and to set a stable foundation for sound economic management, recovery and future growth. We invite all Sri Lankans including overseas Sri Lankans to join us in this endeavor.\nMr. President,\nAs Sri Lanka prepares to undertake the next round of commitments under the UPR process, it is our resolve that, at this historic juncture, tangible steps are taken in the interest of national unity and reconciliation among the people.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\nAgainst this background, we look forward to a constructive engagement with the UPR Working Group this morning as we share our experiences and welcome your suggestions leading towards the voluntary pledges that Sri Lanka will make.

Our national commitment and resolve to make continued progress remain strong despite constraints.

Rule of Law has been further strengthened by the recent decisions of the higher judiciary.\nAs we proceed on our path, we urge this Council to accord due recognition to these gains made by Sri Lanka amidst numerous challenges, including a spate of terrorist attacks that claimed the lives of many hundreds of innocent Sri Lankans as well as foreigners on Easter Sunday this year and that has compelled Sri Lanka to realign its immediate priorities.\n\nMr. President,\n\nI thank you.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "3548000384f93cde83e4e9d2f05edc90"}

{"title": "Speech by Honorable Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 33rd Annual Conference of the Organisation of the Professional Associations of Sri Lanka on 27th June 2020 on the Theme: \u201cBounce Back: Disasters are Opportunities\u201d", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nPresident of the OPA, other officials of the OPA, My dear friends.\n\n\nAt that time, however, the Parliament was under the control of the Yahapalanaya regime. And although I was appointed Prime Minister in keeping with the massive mandate received by the new President the hostile Parliament was not inclined to support the President to pass laws or allocate funds for expenditure already incurred or urgent initiatives as proposed by the new administration.\nIn that background, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had no alternative but to dissolve Parliament at the earliest opportunity in keeping with the Constitution. On that basis, he dissolved Parliament on 3rd of March this year and called for a General Election on 25th of April. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 global pandemic broke out immediately thereafter resulting in the election being postponed by the Elections Commission that lead to a period of major political and economic uncertainty.\nThrough all those political, economic and health challenges, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government was able to deal with the pandemic with outstanding result. Current data show that Sri Lanka has been able to contain the pandemic to just around 2000 cases in a population of 22 million people with only 11 deaths.\nIn contrast, New Zealand, the country which the international media regularly recognises as being the nation that has most effectively managed the pandemic has so far recorded around 1500 COVID-19 patients in a population of just about 5 million people with 22 deaths. That is double the number of deaths in a country which is less than one-fourth of the population of Sri Lanka.\nThat comparison clearly indicates that Sri Lanka has done extremely well in containing the pandemic even though what we have today is an interim government, until the new Parliament is established. In fact, it may be said that what is most vital now is to prevent the economy from weakening, maintain stability, and ensure that the country returns to normal as fast as possible.\nMy dear friends, as we all know, due to the impact of COVID-19, many important sectors of our economy have faced serious risks. Sectors such as tourism, apparel, manufacturing, remittances and several industrial and service sectors have seen significant vulnerabilities and setbacks. The adverse impact of these setbacks has had a harmful effect on the overall Gross Domestic Production in our country.\nIn this background, for an economic revival and turnaround to take place after COVID-19 we must ensure that these affected segments of the economy are supported in a revival plan to ensure accelerated growth. Hence, immediately after this crisis, the country must be prepared to get to work to receive local and foreign investments in sectors such as infrastructure, information technology and transportation.\n\nMy dear friends, as the IMF Managing Director has already said, it will only be through extraordinary initiatives that the world could successfully emerge out of the current economic crisis.\nIt is also no secret that our government too is today grappling with many issues. These issues include the need to increase revenues, enhance growth activities, reduce imports, increase exports, stabilize debt burdens, address increasing unemployment, and revive businesses. In addition, we also need to support the increased needs of vulnerable people, particularly, the children.\nEven in the midst of all this turmoil, we must, as a global community, ensure that children across the world continue to enjoy universal child benefits without interruption. That would indeed be the challenge all developing nations, will encounter in the face of the serious economic pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic fallout.\nMy dear friends, in order to allocate the necessary funds for this vital need at this point of time, the global community will need to come forward to assist all developing nations. One important intervention through which this could be done will be for the IMF and the World Bank to provide a \"Debt standstill\" to all developing nations for a period of around two years. If that is done, those developing nations could allocate the resulting savings of the cash flows towards providing relief and much needed benefits to their children and other vulnerable sections of the population. The provision of such relief will lead to the stimulation of the respective economies and a faster recovery as well, and we believe the global community should seriously consider such a move at this point in time.\nCOVID-19 has battered the world with its deadly impact with millions of people being affected and hundreds of thousands dying. The IMF and the World Bank have predicted a contraction of the global economy by around 3% in 2020, which is a huge setback to the entire world community. Sadly, the virus and its aftermath have seriously damaged the economies of almost all countries, advanced and developing, and left a devastating trail of bankruptcies, livelihood losses, evaporation of savings, debt defaults, economic and corporate collapses and hopelessness.\n\nWe now have to get down to work to implement a focused and practical plan of action for the country to deal with the significant challenge before it, from an economic perspective as well.\n\n\nAs a Professional Member of a Founder Member Organisation of the respected and influential OPA, I am personally aware of your collective strength, experience and dedication. Therefore, I ask you to come forward at this moment of need to contribute your ideas and efforts to face these challenges faced by our beloved Motherland, confidently and effectively. I have no doubt that you will respond positively. Your positive response will send an important message to the rest of the country as well, and assist in the revival and rebuilding effort significantly.\nMy dear friends, I congratulate you for coming forward to assist the country in this hour, and I wish your Conference all success.\nMay the Triple Gem bless you all.\nTheruwan Saranai.\nDevipihitai.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "3832e99652223b1cb08718286105001b"}

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has requested the governments of USA, UK, India, Pakistan and the United Nations to assist in evacuating the Sri Lankans in Afghanistan, should they desire to do so. Foreign Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris has during meetings with relevant envoys requested their assistance to the Sri Lankans in Afghanistan. The Government of Sri Lanka is ready to provide whatever facilities needed for this purpose. Of the total number of Sri Lankans in Afghanistan numbering eighty six (86), so far forty six (46) have already been evacuated. As of today, twenty (20) Sri Lankans are expecting to return from Afghanistan and Foreign Ministry is making arrangements for their evacuation. Meanwhile, twenty (20) other Sri Lankans have expressed their willingness to stay back in Afghanistan.\nThe Government of Sri Lanka is happy to note that the Taliban has offered an amnesty and promised not to harm any foreigners and requests the Taliban to continue honouring that commitment.

Chung Eui-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea\nExcellencies,\nDear Colleagues,\nAt the outset, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to H.E. Chung Eui-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the relevant agencies of the Government of the Republic of Korea for making efficient arrangements at short notice to host the 2021 Seoul UN Peacekeeping Ministerial in a virtual format. We also recognize the valuable contributions made to the 2021 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial process by the 12 member-state co-chairs1, the UN Secretariat including the Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Operational Support.\nSince the first Peacekeeping Summit in 2014, the UN peacekeeping Ministerial process has made an important contribution to the UN peacekeeping operations through mobilizing concrete pledges of uniformed personnel, financial resources, and capacity building for peace keeping operations. It is my hope that the 2021 Ministerial will result in a valuable exchange of ideas and announcement of pledges to benefit current and future UN peacekeeping operations.\nSince the beginning of UN Peacekeeping in 1948, UN peacekeepers have played a vital role in sustaining peace, protection of civilians, and supporting political processes in many regions of the world. Through peacekeeping, the United Nations has come to play a more central role in global affairs and strengthening partnerships among Member States.\n\nBangladesh, Canada, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Japan, the Netherlands, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, Rwanda, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.\n\n\n\n\nToday, Sri Lankan peacekeepers are deployed in some of the most demanding deployments, including in Central Africa, South Sudan and Mali. They have received recognition from the UN for their professionalism and undisputed competence. Throughout the history of our\npeacekeeping contributions, 11 Sri Lankan troops have laid down their lives. We pay tribute to all fallen UN peacekeepers who made the supreme sacrifice in the service of UN peacekeeping.\nI wish to conclude with the sincere hope that the discussions and pledges made at this Ministerial meeting will have a lasting impact on sustaining peace in countries and regions torn by conflict.\n...............................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "3b91e261fdd2376787e5c8b1e9850313"}

{"title": "Statement made by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Foreign Relations at the 43rd Session of the Human Rights Council", "date": "date", "content": "\n\n27 February 2020\nStatement by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Foreign Relations, Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations of Sri Lanka\nMadam President,\nMadam High Commissioner,\nMembers of the HRC and Delegates to the 43rd Session of HRC,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAs this Council deliberates on the written update presented by the High Commissioner on progress regarding the implementation of HRC Resolution 30/1, I wish to reiterate that Sri Lanka remains committed to engaging with the High Commissioner and her Office in achieving sustainable development, peace and reconciliation, within the national framework overwhelmingly approved by the people of Sri Lanka during the Presidential Election last November, where President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected with an overwhelming majority.\nYesterday, the Government of Sri Lanka, at the High Level Segment made clear it's position with regard to HRC Resolution 30/1, particularly, its decision to withdraw from co-sponsorship of Resolution 40/1 of March 2019, which also incorporates and builds on preceding Resolutions 30/1 of October 2015 and 34/1 of March 2017.\n\n\nIn keeping with our consistent policy of continued engagement with the Human Rights Council, Sri Lanka wishes to respond to the current Report of the High Commissioner and engage in a constructive discussion with this august assembly today, with the sincere hope that this Council would recognize the realities on the ground.\n\n\nAs highlighted before this Council on several occasions, Sri Lanka has consistently refuted the credibility of the false and unsubstantiated allegations leveled against Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, the present Commander of Sri Lanka Army and Actg. Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). Sri Lanka considers that the continued arbitrary accusations made against Lt. Gen. Silva in OHCHR Reports and other statements made in this Council and unilateral actions by certain countries, are unacceptable and a violation of the principles of natural justice. We also stress that there are no proven allegations against individuals on war crimes or crimes against humanity in the OISL report or in any subsequent official document. It is an injustice to deprive any serving or retired officer of the Sri Lankan security forces or the police of their due rights.\n\nWith respect to references in the report to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution that established Provincial Councils, it must be noted that, soon after the end of the conflict, the citizens in the Northern Province were able to use their franchise at a Provincial Council election after a lapse of 25 years. However, the near two year delay in holding Provincial Council elections in any part of the country, by the previous Government which co-sponsored Resolution 30/1, with the active support of Members of Parliament representing the North and East, has hampered the operationalization of devolution of power as mandated by the constitution of Sri Lanka. The new Government, is committed to holding the Provincial Council elections at the earliest possible opportunity, upon suitable amendments being made to the requirements that are needed to conduct the provincial council elections in terms of the law.\n\nThe existing reconciliation mechanisms established by an Act of Parliament such as the Office on Mission Persons (OMP) and the Office of Reparations (OR) will be continued, with appropriate adaptation in line with Government policy framework. With regard to the issues on missing persons, steps would be taken, after necessary investigations, to issue death certificates or certificates of absence, while also providing livelihood and other assistance to affected families;\n\nNational law enforcement systems will continue to investigate and prosecute cases on all allegations of torture and other human rights violations that are currently before the judicial processes.\nWe hope the Council would appreciate this approach of focusing on deliverable measures of reconciliation that are in line with the interest of Sri Lanka and its people, instead of the practice of taking on a host of undeliverable commitments with the intention of never implementing them.\nWithin the above parameters, we look forward to continuing our engagement with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Human Rights mechanisms and procedures, and to continue to work in close cooperation with the international community through capacity building and technical assistance in mutually agreed areas, in keeping with domestic priorities and policies.\nThank you.\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n", "id": "3c0b0f48bc233da197f3c14949a3baba"}

{"title": "Foreign Minister reassures continued repatriation of migrant workers", "date": "date", "content": "\nForeign Relations, Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has reassured that the repatriation of migrant workers from the Middle East as well as other regions will continue, in a manner sensitive to the vulnerability of these communities, particularly those who have lost legal status and/or employment in their host countries. This will be done in consultation with the COVID Task Force, in view of the considerable strain presently placed on the health sector and quarantine centres following the increased number of COVID infected persons who have recently returned from Kuwait. It was noted that it is proposed to explore the possibility of getting PCR tests done prior to boarding all flights in future.\nThe Minister made these observations at a meeting held this evening (29 May 2020) at the Foreign Ministry attended by Foreign Secretary RavinathaAryasinha, Ministry of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations SecretarySarathAbeygunawardana, Chairman Sri Lankan Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE) Kamal Ratwatte, and relevant officials of the two ministries and the SLBFE.\nIt was noted that according to the latest update, as at 27 May, 42,522 persons from 123 countries were seeking to return to Sri Lanka. Of these, migrant workers amounted to 34,881 of which 20,893 are living in the Middle East, while 4,961 were short term visa holders, and 2,016 were students.\nTaking stock of the developments concerning those repatriated from Kuwait, it was noted that of the 466 returnees, 379 were those benefiting from the amnesty who had surrendered to the camps between 21-25 April and had been awaiting repatriation. 87 were those from Kuwaiti detention centres and prisons. Through Diplomatic Notes on 11 and 14 May 2020, prior to their eventual departure from Kuwait on two Kuwait Airways flights on 19 May, the Sri Lanka Embassy in Kuwait had requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kuwait to conduct PCR tests on those being repatriated. However the Mission was informed that this would not be possible and that no passenger with COVID symptoms would be allowed to board the aircraft. It had also been stated that PCR tests had not been done on any of the returnees from other countries leaving Kuwait.\nIt was pointed out that at present the greatest vulnerability was in the Maldives, but particularly in Greater Male where a red alert has been declared by the Maldivian Government, which has explicitly requested foreign governments to evacuate their citizens. Of approximately 7000 presently seeking repatriation from the Maldives, almost 2000 are in Greater Male. On 14 May, 284 were repatriated and special approval had to be secured to evacuate a few medical emergency cases from outer Male. The Foreign Ministry has consulted the Maldivian authorities, who have expressed willingness for PCR tests to be done in advance on Sri Lankans to be repatriated, provided that PCR test kits and medical personnel from Sri Lanka would be made available to conduct these tests.\nAt the request of the COVID Task Force, the Foreign Relations Ministry has also consulted the other capitals from where repatriation flights are planned to the Middle East and elsewhere, to ascertain the possibility of conducting PCR tests prior to taking flights. It was noted that in most, PCR testing is only available for those showing serious symptoms due to limited facilities.\nThe SLBFE informed the meeting that to bolster the present capacity, four SLBFE training centres have been made available to the COVID Task Force for quarantine purposes in Haliella, Tangalle, Dambulla and Polonnaruwa.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the SLBFE will continue to support migrant communities abroad through the provision of dry rations and medicines, and helping with medical emergencies in their locations, while continuing to facilitate repatriation for those seeking to do so.\nIt was reiterated that the determination of those to be repatriated is based on vulnerability, conscious that this has changed from time to time. Starting with the initial wave of student repatriations, presently the concerned Missions strictly follow the chronological order in which the various categories - students, short term visitors and migrant workers, have registered their interest to return with the Missions. Other than for the Maldives, where all are deemed to be equally vulnerable in Greater Male, in the 15 other stations where SLBFE officers operate, deciding who in the migrant category should be prioritized, is done by the Head of Mission/Post in consultation with the SLBFE representative attached to the respective Mission. Priority is given to those who have lost their legal status or employment. Additionally a few exceptions with medical emergencies with documentary evidence, have been considered as special cases for repatriation. Missions have been instructed to strictly adhere to this protocol.\nMinistry of Foreign Relations\nColombo\n\n29 May 2020\n----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "3dc8bb8994063eec918799bd06da355a"}

The severe economic crisis emanating from factors both internal and external offer many lessons for all of us. We recall in this context the indivisibility of human rights, as enshrined in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. The Government is extremely sensitive to the socio-economic hardships faced by our people, and has initiated immediate multi-pronged measures to address the challenges and to ensure their wellbeing through the provision of supplies essential to the life of the community. A staff level agreement has been reached with the International Monetary Fund, and discussions on debt restructuring are in progress. The Government is in dialogue with UN agencies as well as bilateral partners to protect the most vulnerable from the adverse impacts of the crisis. In spite of multiple challenges, Sri Lanka would endeavour to remain on course in meeting the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe recent changes that have taken place bear testimony to our continued commitment to upholding our longstanding democratic principles and norms. The constitutional rights to peaceful assembly and expression guaranteed the democratic space for our people to exercise their rights. In this regard, transgressions of the law resulting in criminal and unlawful activity were addressed in accord with the law and the Constitution, in circumstances where such freedoms were abused by elements with vested interests to achieve undemocratic political ends.\nMr. President,\nNotwithstanding the severe constraints and challenges, Sri Lanka remains firmly committed to pursuing tangible progress in the protection of human rights and reconcilation through independent domestic institutions.\nSri Lanka along with several Members of this Council have opposed resolution 46/1, fundamentally disagreeing with its legitimacy and objectives. We have consistently highlighted that the content of the resolution, its operative paragraph 06 in particular, violates the sovereignty of the people of Sri Lanka and the principles of the UN Charter. Once again, we are compelled to categorically reject any follow-up measures to the resolution, as well as the related recommendations and conclusions by the High Commissioner.\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President,\nMeasures aimed at promoting domestic reconciliation and human rights, if they are to be meaningful and sustainable, must be based on cooperation with the country concerned, be compatible with the aspirations of its people, and be consonant with its basic legal framework. The international community is aware that unconstitutional and intrusive external initiatives have repeatedly failed to yield meaningful results on the ground, and are in effect an unproductive drain on member state resources.\nThe Government would endeavour to establish a credible truth-seeking mechanism within the framework of the Constitution. The contours of such a model that would suit the particular conditions of Sri Lanka are under discussion.\n\nAs we delivered on the onerous task of review and reform of the PTA this year, to further enhance human rights, we will replace the PTA with a more comprehensive national security legislation in accordance with international best practices.\nThe recent delisting of groups and individuals will provide further impetus for constructive dialogue.\nThe independent statutory bodies established to advance the rights of victims and their families, and to provide reparations, continue to vigourously execute their respective mandates.\nThe Office on Missing Persons (OMP) has commenced the process of inquiry and verification, set up separate units on Tracing and Victim and Family Support, and acts as an Observer on relevant judicial proceedings.\nDespite economic constraints, the Office for Reparations (OR) continues to deliver on its mandate, and the recently adopted National Reparations Policy and Guidelines have expanded the work of the Office beyond monetary compensation, to other forms of support.\nThe necessary support and resources to strengthen the functioning of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), continue to be provided.\nThe outreach to overseas Sri Lankans encompassing all communities and generations will be expanded through the establishment of an Office for Overseas Sri Lankans, thus facilitating more vigourous engagement.\nMr. President,\nAs recognized in the Universal Declaration, human rights are interdependent, interrelated and indivisible. In upholding human rights, we have benefitted from the considerable expertise available with other countries as well as the United Nations. We will seek further advice and support on best practices as we proceed, and as deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\nThank you.\n....................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "3ec99cd45d76343da4efd4cf1c2ec717"}

{"title": "Address by the State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, at the 4th Ministerial Meeting (MM-4) of the Archipelagic and Island States (AIS) Forum on 6 December, 2022", "date": "date", "content": "\nExcellency Luhut B. Panjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs of Indonesia,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nAt the outset, I wish to extend my deep appreciation, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, to the Government of Indonesia for the exceptional hospitality and courtesies extended to me and my delegation. I also congratulate His Excellency Luhut B. Panjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs of Indonesia, the UNDP Office in Indonesia and the AIS Secretariat for their tireless efforts in organizing this high-profile event.\nSri Lanka, similar to other island states, is rich in biodiversity, as well as ethnic and cultural diversity, which sets us apart from the rest of the world. However, climate induced disasters, biodiversity depletion, over-exploitation, pollution, ocean acidification and rising sea-levels are looming ahead of us now more than ever and we need collaborative and concerted efforts to safeguard the archipelagic and island states.\nExcellencies and Distinguished delegates,\nSri Lanka is uniquely positioned within the Indian Ocean and remains committed to preserve ocean health while sustainably utilizing maritime resources in a manner that would yield intrinsic benefits. Sri Lanka is conscious that a lack of capacity on the part of global hegemons to address concerns of an international scale would have an intense impact on the AIS countries whose wealth of resources extend across land and sea.\nSri Lanka welcomes the initiative to convene the 1st High Level Meeting (HLM) next year with the participation of Heads of States. We strongly maintain that the High Level Meeting will be able to draw increased global focus on the AIS Forum. This would promote AIS objectives, serving the purpose for which this Forum has been established. It would also make a greater impact by voicing a strong collective opinion that would be heard at the highest decision-making level.\nExcellencies and Distinguished delegates,\n\nThis initiative will also provide an opportunity to disseminate and manifest the vision of the AIS Forum as the University will focus on oceanic natural capital, health, governance and related concerns as these are vital components in climate change. I invite this Forum to collaborate with Sri Lanka in this effort, moving forward.\nExcellencies and Distinguished Delegates,\nEach sovereign country is responsible for its own marine resources and sustainable development. The need for structured international cooperation underpins all aspects of the blue economy. As an open-ended, inclusive, and development-focused ocean cooperation platform, this Forum should utilize this unique opportunity to strengthen and elevate collaborative efforts to identify the most efficacious strategies in allocating resources effectively and efficiently.\n\nExcellencies and Distinguished delegates,\nBeing intimately aware of the importance of ocean ecosystems in order to take suitable climate actions, Sri Lanka has, thus, recognized investments in reef restoration to preserve marine biodiversity, sustain fisheries and ocean-centric livelihoods to sustain food production and food security. The Country Prosperity Plan which was recently launched during the COP27 will be the roadmap for Sri Lanka to attract foreign investment to boost economic growth, contributing to post-pandemic recovery, accelerating climate adaptation, and bringing down greenhouse gas emissions. Sri Lanka is willing to share our experience with member states of this Forum to ensure that we leave no one behind.\nExcellencies and Distinguished delegates,\nThe destruction of the marine environment due to ill-considered spatial policies has continued to deteriorate the health of our oceans. This is why Sri Lanka has commenced the development of a holistic Marine Spatial Plan (MSP). Sri Lanka is currently scoping out the principles, approach, and governance of the MSP process to contribute to elevating the blue economy of Sri Lanka.\n\nExcellencies and Distinguished delegates,\n\nWhile there have been marine disasters before, Sri Lanka has never confronted one with such poisonous cargo. Marine pollution is a transboundary issue that affects us all. It was evident, when scientists predicted that the ecological effects of the MV X-Press Pearl would affect the entire region, including Indonesia.\nExcellencies and Distinguished delegates,\nThis level of interconnection is the crux of why regional and international coordination will be pivotal in order to ensure a successful outcome in addressing ocean pollution. In order to address the lack of coordination during maritime disasters and marine pollution incidents, at the UN Ocean Conference in 2022, Sri Lanka has proposed that an International Maritime Disaster Recovery Mechanism be developed to deal with oil spills, chemical spills as well as spills of hazardous and noxious material and plastic nurdles and other maritime disasters.\nTo this end, a collective initiative of a rapid response mechanism is an urgent need. Sri Lanka invites the AIS Forum to work towards establishing a concrete mechanism to respond swiftly and assist in post-disaster recovery.\nExcellencies and Distinguished delegates,\nIn conclusion, let us have faith in the goals of AIS Forum, confidence in our vision and a commitment to a programme of action in pursuit of them. We must strengthen our institutional framework to facilitate effective collaboration within the AIS Forum. Sri Lanka is confident that we as a Forum can achieve our collective goals for the future by sharing our experiences and best practices.\nI thank you for your kind attention and I wish this forum every success!\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "3f2593acc46939db9ba1c3c82e099f6d"}

The Supreme Court ordered for a fresh legislation on this matter. For nearly 3 years, the HRC or Western countries having not taken issue with the delay of elections to Provincial Councils, including that of the Northern Province, however, presently have projected it as a major issue, at a time the current government has taken the initiative to conduct the election at the earliest possible.\n\nHaving had Sri Lanka co-sponsor UN Resolution 30/1 in October 2015 and extracted a commitment that Sri Lanka will initiate an accountability mechanism which would include foreign judges and lawyers, which was unconstitutional, for 5 years neither the UN bodies nor the US and other proponents of this resolution, pressed the previous government to carry out its promises.\n\nForeign Ministry\nColombo\n05 June 2021\n..........................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "4085b1c91cf8398da8652dffe1376a4f"}

While appreciating the role of the media he urged the media to be cautious in disseminating the correct information to the general public so as not to give into panic unnecessarily, whilst being agile to the dangers of the virus.\n\nForeign Secretary Ravinatha Aryasinha in his opening remarks informed Sri Lanka's preparedness and the resultant successful evacuation of Sri Lankan students from Wuhan. The Secretary appreciated the cooperation of the Chinese Government towards this end.

Foreign Secretary Aryasinha also stated that a few sporadic alleged incidents of selective treatment does not reflect the general situation in the country.\nDirector General of Health Dr Anil Jasinghe stated that the threat of COVID-19 has reached a level of public health emergency of international concern and as a result, the Health Ministry has embarked on a vigorous plan to strengthen the domestic health facilities. As an initial step, 17 hospitals across the country have been designated and well equipped to deal with the likely COVID-19 pandemic. The Director General also stated that since the situation is fluid, the COVID-19 case definition is also redefined and as of today, passengers from Iran, South Korea and Italy are considered to be potential carriers of the virus. The Government, as a precautionary measure has decided to quarantine those who are travelling either from or through the above mentioned three countries. The DG also confirmed that despite the decision to quarantine, the date of operationalisation of the plans are yet to be decided since the construction of quarantine facilities are underway.\nResident Representative of the WHO Dr Razia Narayan Pendse highlighting the gravity of the situation across countries, pointed out that a combined Government and society approach is the need of the hour to manage any likely outbreak of COVID-19 in Sri Lanka. She added that an inter-agency collaborative approach to reverse any adverse situation is critical at this point of time. Dr Pendse said she could clearly witness the much needed political will, and the multi-sectoral collaboration and cooperation, which have been prevalent so far towards resolving the challenges. The Representative was appreciative of the roles of the authorities of Foreign Relations, Health, Defence and Immigration and stated that educating the general public, expansion of surveillance, and strengthening of preparedness are important aspects to interrupting the transmission of the virus.\nMinistry of Foreign Relations\nColombo\n\n6 March 2020\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "41ce88dc4c8b30db8bb365a434738953"}

Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, with the assistance of Major General K.H.G. Hendawitharana, representing the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development.\nThe principal purpose of the briefing was to give the diplomatic community authentic information regarding action taken by the government against groups and individuals involved in terrorist funding and other activity connected with plans to revive terrorism. \n\nProf. Peiris told the diplomatic community that there is compelling evidence regarding the remittance of substantial sums of money from overseas for planned terrorist activity. As a result of extensive investigations in recent weeks, the government is aware of the sources of this funding in several instances and the bank accounts into which the money had been paid. 65 arrests have been made, and 19 persons have been released after questioning.\nA wealth of information, including documentary evidence and primary evidence of communications between the parties concerned, is now at the disposal of the government, the Minister said. The emerging picture indicates activity by several networks, including links between activists operating from broad and recipients of funds within Sri Lanka. Weapons, documents and other material have been found in consequence of information elicited during questioning. From the material available, it is clear that the funds sent are intended to be used for military, intelligence and propaganda purposes, with groups of persons and others operating under their direction assigned responsibility in respect of each of these areas. While the investigations are continuing, and further information is coming to light regarding the identity and role of other participants, the elaborate nature of the preparations revealed by the evidence already obtained, leaves no room for doubt that an intricate planning apparatus is sought to be established, Prof. Peiris added.\n\nProf. Peiris drew attention to the attempt in some quarters to paint a picture of a threat to tourism and investment. The Minister characterized these attempts as entirely unwarranted and mischievous. The government is in total control of the situation, and has every confidence of eradicating at the very inception, any attempt to revive terrorism in any form in any part of the country, he commented.\n\nHe underlined the importance of pre-emptive action to deal with the kinds of activity he had described, and requested all nations represented at the briefing to extend their fullest co-operation in preventing the inflow of funds for terrorist purposes and forestalling all forms of activity which these resources are intended to support.\n\nMinistry of External Affairs\nColombo\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "4581c51d27bd3b999eb808f6e4ac2019"}

The EU and Sri Lanka agreed on the importance to continue working closely together on human rights and reconciliation, issues which figured prominently on the agenda of the meeting.\n\nSri Lanka reaffirmed the commitments made to implement 27 conventions on human and labour rights, environment and good governance in order to benefit from the GSP+ scheme. In this context, while acknowledging that the new draft legislation was now being considered by Parliament, the EU reiterated the need to repeal and replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) in order to bring counterterrorism legislation in line with international standards.\nThe EU also reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances and encouraged Sri Lanka to maintain its moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty.\nThe meeting provided an opportunity to exchange views on the implementation of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution of 1 October 2015, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka.

{"title": "Opening Remarks by Admiral Professor Jayanath Colombage, Foreign Secretary, on the occasion of the \u00a0Second Meeting of the IORA Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security Colombo, Sri Lanka,  18th March 2021", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nGood morning Ladies and Gentlemen, Excellencies,\nHannah Singer, the U.N. Resident Coordinator in Colombo\nDr. Gatot H. Gunawan, Acting Secretary General of IORA,\nYour Excellencies, Members of the Diplomatic Corps,\nMr. Alan Cole, Head of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Global Maritime Crime Programme and the generous support from the Government of Japan,\nSenior Officials representing the Navy and other stakeholders in Sri Lanka, Distinguished delegates from IORA Member States who are joining us virtually.\nLet me welcome you all, with the traditional Sri Lankan greeting, Ayubowan! May you all live long, especially in this COVID pandemic period, we need that wish more than ever. And of course, unfortunately there is another wave going up in many parts of the world, so this is not yet over.\nAnd I am happy that we were instrumental in getting you the vaccination, most of you, and we made our diplomatic community in Colombo a priority in the vaccination programme although we have only received a very limited quantity because we consider that you are our guest. We have a responsibility to look after you first before we look after ourselves.\nSo, allow me to extend a warm welcome to the French Republic, the newest member of the IORA.\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great pleasure to welcome you to the second meeting of IORA Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security. And we call it the IORA WGMSS.\nI like to extend a warm thank you for all those who are present here physically, this is a challenging time. Even to conduct an event physically is a challenge. Of course, we maintain the health protocol and also those who are joining us virtually from across the Indian Ocean. And I also like to thank the Ocean Affairs Division led by my able colleague Hasanthi and her wonderful team in the Foreign Ministry for coordinating and making this event a reality. And let me also thank all those who have assisted in organising this event and also working on this working group with the intention of deriving a positive outcome.\nBut I must say now time has come to translate our discussion into action. We have been discussing about this maritime safety and security for quite some time. Yes, we have achieved things, but I think it's high time that we really translate our talk into the action. Also, I like to thank, as usual, our partner, the Global Maritime Crime Program of the United Nations, under the able guidance of our dear friend Alan Cole, who is always there with us in anything regarding the ocean and the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute and also special thank goes to the government of Japan for generous contribution to make this event a reality.\nAnd I also like to thank the IORA member states on behalf of the government of Sri Lanka for the for extending their unstinted support during the last few years that we were in the helm of maritime safety and maritime security. You all know, or probably you may be knowing that Sri Lanka has offered to be the vice chair for the tenuous starting in 2020. And we have received great support from the IORA members, and we really appreciate that as well. We are committed and pleased to provide its utmost support to IORA Secretariat and the member states in achieving our common objectives across the Indian Ocean.\nSri Lanka conducted the first meeting in August 2019, and of course, we were hoping to conduct the second meeting in 2020, but unfortunately, we could not do it physically. And then when we tried to do it virtually, it was taking time because all of us are busy with different scenarios across the globe. But finally, we are happy we could do this today.\nWe know that global politics, shifting already or shifted to the oceans, that's for sure, and we also know the Indian Ocean is either already or rapidly becoming a key ocean in global politics, global maritime affairs and also the Indian Ocean littorals about 35 percent of world population and one fifth of global GDP is in the region of the Indian Ocean. And also, it is estimated that by 2025, this region could be the source of a quarter of world economic output and around 15 percent of its trade. This prosperous future will be linked to the ocean.\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, we all think the ocean is about shipping and we all think that the data we get on our smartphones is coming from the sky. But the real fact is it is coming under the deep ocean through submarine cables. We know that 80 percent of internal Internet traffic is transferred through submarine cables. And I'm happy that Sri Lanka, again, together with the UNODC, has taken the initiative to ensure security of this very vital lifeline of the world, so to say, because we all know, I don't know how long we can survive without the Internet, if we can survive a day, I think that's an achievement. But then all these cables are they are in the deep ocean. And when they are in the ocean, accidents can happen. Natural disasters can take place. So how do we secure these vital submarine cables across the Indian Ocean? That's something we really need to pay a lot of attention to.\nThe ocean is very dynamic. It is changing every time. I mean, what we discussed last year may not be relevant this year. Of course, there are certain common things like maritime crime. We call it the maritime crime trinity, that is drugs, human smuggling and weapons smuggling. It is prevalent. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is there. The FAO report released a few weeks ago said 40 percent of fishing taking place in the Indian Ocean is IUU fishing.\nNow, IUU fishing is not only taking the catch, but destroying the environment, marine environment as well. And we all know that the illegal narcotics trade is there. Of course, you can see that in Sri Lanka, the drug trade is going down, but still it is coming in different forms. When we tackle one particular type, there is another type emerging because it is a very lucrative business.\nAnd then environmental or marine environmental pollution is taking place. And we need to appeal to the big countries because, you know, per capita, they pollute more than a small country. And we already know there is a 60,000 square kilometre dead zone in the Bay of Bengal, no life, no fish, no marine life. And we all know there is a huge garbage patch in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, and we keep adding at least 8 million metric tons of plastic every year. So very soon, ladies and gentlemen, there'll be more plastic in the ocean than the fish. So, this is the danger.\nNow, again, I have to say that I do see another three trends emerging or already emerged in the Indian Ocean. Number one, politicisation of the maritime trade. Number two, politicisation of maritime related infrastructure. Number three, increased militarisation of the Indian Ocean. I can argue with anyone with facts and figures and examples. These three trends are taking place across the Indian Ocean. Now, in this backdrop, why do we need as Indian Ocean littorals? And I have a simple answer. Why do we really need? We need international rules based maritime order. And enhance maritime trade connectivity. These are the two things the majority of countries in the Indian Ocean rim area or the region wants, we need a rules-based because we have a huge asymmetry in this region. All the countries are not equal. All the militaries and all the navies are not equal. So, the best way to overcome this asymmetry is having an international rules-based maritime order. But is that enough? Only by having an international rules-based maritime order is that enough, is my question. It is not enough. Then what do we need? We need enhanced maritime connectivity and to be part of the global supply chain and the maritime trade.\nAnd therefore, the theme of IORA after adapting, strengthening maritime cooperation for a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indian Ocean. Now, this is a critical challenge that we have, and we have been talking about this strengthening maritime cooperation for a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indian Ocean. But then look at 2021. Have the nations become prosperous in the Indian Ocean? I mean, when I say all nations and the answer is no. And one of the major predicaments of many littoral countries in the Indian Ocean is lack of quality maritime infrastructure. Now, without that, how can we enhance maritime connectivity? We all know South Asian region. We are the least integrated region in the whole world. Only less than five percent of our combined GDP is economically integrated. So where are we heading? We can understand.\nNow in 2019, Sri Lanka hosted the first working group on maritime safety and security. Ladies and gentlemen, now we are in 2021. Of course, now we are meeting today, and we need to move on. And as I said, it is high time we translate our talking into action. If we don't do that, we can forget about the Indian Ocean because outside powers will take control of the Indian Ocean unless the Indian Ocean littorals can get their act together. This is the warning that I like to present to this forum. Food for thought. Sri Lanka has been doing many exercises, the VBSS exercises, and we supported the Pathfinder Virtual Conference on Indian Ocean Security Conference, again with Japan.\n\nBut ladies and gentlemen, I think it is time we take stock of these three concepts. How far have we gone? How much have we achieved? And unfortunately, I think the pollution level is still high. I think the IUU fishing is still high, maritime crime is still high. Mistrust and trust deficiency are still high. So, when we look back, I don't know whether we can be extremely happy with the progress that IORA has made.\nAnd I feel that we have a very long way to go if IORA is to be a meaningful organization contributing to these very concepts that we hold dear. So, I assure you that Sri Lanka is committed to continue its contribution and leadership towards achieving objectives of this working group. We gained a lot of experience fighting at sea for 30 long years with the terrorist group, the only terrorist group in the world so far, which had a nearly conventional standing army, a small Navy and Air Force. No other terrorist group had ever had that. But here we fought it. So, we gained a lot of experience at sea. I think after the Falklands War in 1982, the only operational navy which actually engaged in actual combat is the Sri Lankan Navy. So, we combined that experience and expertise into the Working Group on Maritime Security and Safety.\nWe are entering a very contemporary, challenging world. We need to be together. We need to work together. No single country can be the next net security provider. No single country can be the net developing provider in the Indian Ocean.\nI'm sure we agree that it requires a coordinated multilateral approach to maritime security unless we can get this multilateral combined approach. Even without us knowing, another threat can emerge in the maritime domain. Our success, and the success of generations yet unborn will depend on the decisions we make today. If we make the right choices, the future generations will remember us. If we don't make that choice, they will curse us. And I believe we have no right to rob from the future generations their future, they should be enjoying the ocean that we enjoyed. So we need to work together collaboratively, multilaterally, with a sincere commitment to achieve tangible, measurable results, not only meeting, talking, producing reports and then coming back and meeting again and producing another report. It looks very attractive to have so many reports, but it is high time that we walk the talk as the Indian Ocean Rim Association.\nWith this, ladies and gentlemen, I conclude my keynote address. Once again, I'm delighted to see all of you here. I see a lot of ambassadors, high commissioners are here, it's a great feeling. Thank you once again for being with us this morning. And I wish you happy sailing.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "48ae9fede2673403b9302577991645c1"}

Its tasks include ensuring the implementation of the Agreement; setting mutually agreed priorities; and making constructive recommendations. The Commission accordingly deals with a broad range of bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest to the EU and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe 21st meeting of the Joint Commission was held in an open and constructive spirit. The EU and Sri Lanka welcomed the formal restoration of the GSP Plus regime to Sri Lanka in May 2017, providing duty free access for more than 80% of Sri Lankan exports to the European Union, the world's largest economy, and Sri Lanka's largest export market. Sri Lanka stated that initial indications showed that the restoration of GSP Plus had contributed to a near doubling of export growth. The trade preferences scheme was restored in recognition of the progress made by Sri Lanka in implementing the 27 international conventions listed in the GSP Regulation relating to human rights, labour, good governance and the environment.\n\nThe EU and Sri Lanka remain committed to continuing bilateral discussions through the respective Working Groups and the GSP+ monitoring process with a view to further strengthening the implementation of the provisions of the 27 conventions.\n\n\n\nIn light of the lifting of the EU ban on export of fish from Sri Lanka, the participants of the Joint Commission noted the value that increased fishing exports would bring to the economy and the livelihoods of Sri Lankan fishing communities. Sri Lanka reiterated its continued commitment to managing and controlling fisheries in compliance with its international obligations.\nThe EU welcomed the participation of Sri Lankan students, scholars and universities in EU higher education and research cooperation programmes. It further encouraged more applications from Sri Lanka in light of the available opportunities.\nThe parties agreed on a series of follow-up actions ahead of the next Joint Commission meeting in Brussels later in the year.\nThe meeting was co-chaired by Ms. Paola Pampaloni, Deputy Managing Director for Asia and Pacific of the European External Action Service, and Mr. Prasad Kariyawasam, Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka.\nColombo\n18 January 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinhala Translation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTamil Translation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "49464a18c75f3b369f0623cef5c5d11e"}

Rising cost of living and energy costs as well as debt crisis among the countries have relegated countries such as Sri Lanka to unprecedented economic risks and challenges. In this light, as a solution for the current global economic crisis, IORA could redefine its work agenda to suit economic cooperation among the countries. While making the Indian Ocean central to economic cooperation, IORA could develop a framework to accelerate its activities on economic cooperation among the countries. We, fervently, look forward to work with coordinating countries on trade and economic cooperation to enhance our common agenda in this realm.\nIn conclusion, let me once again reiterate that IORA brings together socially, culturally, geographically, economically and politically diverse groups of countries under one platform. This unique and critically salient platform could transform and translate the future of the Indian Ocean, if we pool and synergise all our ideas and visions together to work effectively for the betterment and advancement of our countries.

The Minister acknowledged the country having successfully embarked into online platforms to conduct technical and vocational training courses, which have assisted in the expansion of the training capacity and thereby supporting life-long learning. As a result of these continuous efforts, he referred to the introduction of the National Skills Passport, marking the entry of the country into a golden era of vocational training.\nAmbassador Kshenuka Senewiratne, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in her remarks emphasized that, considering youth to be the backbone of any nation, every effort must be made to continue to engage and involve this young segment in grasping the opportunities provided with the changing world of work including digitization, and in moving to the New Normal consequent to the devastation posed by the pandemic. She upheld that digitalization has become more important with the current health challenge and can have a positive impact on the innovating strength of developing countries, and young people must become proactively involved in this process. Ambassador Senewiratne welcomed the initiatives taken by youth on their own to support national crisis responses to the pandemic, and underlined the need to concertedly work together on skills development, to make youth more competent in serving both the present and future.\nYoung people are key agents in fighting climate change, recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and achieving the 2030 Agenda, however they are also at risk of being left behind in education and employment during their crucial stage of development due to the pandemic observed the President of the General Assembly Tijjani Muhammed Bande.

Mohan Peiris,\nPermanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations\nFriday, 05 March 2021\nGeneral Assembly Hall, UNHQ (in-person )\nMr. President,\nI thank the Permanent Representatives of Spain and Oman for the fine role that they are playing as co-facilitators of the Seventh Review of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. I also wish to thank the United Nations Under-Secretary-General of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism for the presentation on the comprehensive Report by the UN Secretary-General on the activities of the UN system in implementing the Strategy.\nAs we gather here today, in this Assembly Hall, and deliberate on this most important subject, I was wondering how many amongst us, would have personally experienced in some form or another the real horrible effects of terrorism. Some of us may have experienced it more than others. For some of our fellow citizens back at home, at one point in time it may have even become a way of life, as it might be the case even today for some of our Member States. The fear of getting on a public transport to get to work, the fear of sending your child to school, anxiously waiting for your loved ones to return home safely, the ability to go about your daily work without fear or anxiety is common in certain parts of our world, even as we speak.\nMr. President, when your fellow citizens are unable to lead their lives without the guarantee of their most fundamental rights, what is a responsible government constitutionally mandated to do? How should it respond? This was the dilemma facing the Government of Sri Lanka. For nearly 30 years we tried a cocktail of mechanisms from peace talks to ceasefires with the aid of our interlocutors, however the high price, to bring the group of non-state actors responsible for their extremely brutal terror tactics to the table, into the democratic fold. Regrettably all these efforts did not work. Innocent men, women and children continued to be terrorized, lost their lives and we witnessed the loss of public assets. Their distorted ideologies continued to incite hatred along ethnic lines even as I speak sitting in the comfort of jurisdictions outside. Finally, the Government had no choice but to carry out the humanitarian operation in 2009 that finally liberated the people of Sri Lanka from the clutches of that group of non-state actors.\nMr. President, Sri Lanka has come a long way since those dark days. If you really think about it, it is somewhat surprising that for a country that had borne the brunt of nearly 03 decades of terrorism, we are where we are today. There is peace in the country. It is a success story. Ironically there is amongst us those who find peace an inconvenient environment. Peace is anathema to their geopolitical aspirations which are played out through the pawns of terror namely Non State Actors. We see today that by a far more sophisticated machinations terrorists have gained access to our governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, religious organizations, the judiciary and the entire canvas of human activity. However democracy prevails. No doubt challenges remain. However, we remain confident that with the resilience of the Sri Lankan people and the strong leadership of the Government supported, by the United Nations, we will continue to address these challenges having due respect for the rule of law and Human Rights.\nThese terror groups are so powerful today that they have the power to move the very international organizations we represent today, to use our own mechanisms such as our Human Rights mechanisms, to neutralize our continued fight against terror. They know that we have humane hearts. But we cannot allow such humanity to be abused to create nurseries for terrorists and extremists. We cannot be seen to be hunting with the hound and running with the hare. Our message to terror must be loud and clear. The message must clearly be zero-tolerance and that our commitment to Human Rights is not an opportunity to vindicate the programs of terror structured conveniently on the basis of a political agenda.\nThis morning, I heard the laudable observation that we will respond to terror taking due cognizance of Human Rights. An absolutely sacred and fine principle to adopt. It will however be most welcome if the Counter-Terrorism Strategy would recommend to this assembly the guiding principles by which Member States could respond in achieving this fine balance by which the fight against terror and the respect for human rights can subsist in the context of the observation by the Hon. Lord David Blunkett, a former Minister of the British Government, when he told the British Parliament that the Public have a fundamental right to be protected from terrorism. A case by case basis which can be a convenience basis might be suggestive of a timid, compromised response. It is these measured diplomatic messages that terrorists and their likeminded cohorts find encouraging. Mr. President, be assured that Sri Lanka is committed to a Counter-Terrorism Strategy locally and globally, without losing control of constitutionalism.\n\nI take this opportunity to extend to my colleagues, the Ambassadors of Spain and Oman, the full cooperation of my delegation as they steer these important discussions in the coming days. Mr. President, Sri Lanka condemns terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations and will continue to play its role in the international community to find innovative and pragmatic solutions for the betterment of our people.\nThank you.\n......................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "536fb660c5bf3f0f9e8781cba7d5e746"}

Those who show flu symptoms have been asked to self-quarantine whilst seeking medical attention. Both the police and the Public Health Inspectors are closely monitoring the progress of the suspected patients.

All education centers from pre-schools to universities had been closed, ranging from two to six weeks. Even religious gatherings have been discouraged for two weeks. Besides these measures, sanitizing of public transport has commenced and 16 March had been declared a public holiday to keep people from the roads.\n\n\nPM Modi, as he opened the forum noted that our societies are deeply connected and thus we must be prepared together to face the challenges ahead.\n\nHe emphasized the need to be careful instead of panicking and that the threat should not be underestimated.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of conference, PM Modi advocated a joint effort to combat the challenges posed to the region by the virus. He proposed a CORVID 19 emergency fund for the SAARC countries can draw from to deal with the related issues. Contributing to this fund would be an entirely a voluntary decision, said PM Modi. As a starting point though, he pledged USD 10 million, which through the India Foreign Ministry and related missionaries could be accessed.\nPM Modi also assured shared resources and knowledge as medical expertise, testing kits and other equipment as well as online training for health workers.

The fundamental deficiency is its intolerably intrusive character, impinging as it does on core functions and responsibilities of organs of the Sri Lankan State, overwhelmingly mandated by the people of our country at three successive elections. There is, as well, a clearly discernible element of discrimination, in that the Council would certainly not take it upon itself to embark on a similar inquisitorial procedure in respect of other Member States. This, in itself, strikes at the very root of the foundations of the United Nations system. The issue of uniformity and consistency of standards applied by the High Commissioner to Member States, irrespective of their size and influence, and in steadfast conformity with the essential principle relating to the sovereign equality of all members of the United Nations fraternity, is cynically transgressed in several portions of this report.\n\n\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka is firmly resolved to maintain the security and stability that we have restored for our people and ensure sustainable progress in an equitable manner. My country reaches out to the international community with the sincere exhortation to join us as partners on a footing of equality and mutual respect to face the challenges ahead.\nI thank you, Mr. President.\n......................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.........................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "569cfe08a53431b9b4b156496d58fa5f"}

Jawad, Additional Secretary, Multilateral Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Relations observed that high-level leadership would be crucial for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals since these Goals are of a cross cutting nature, coming under the purview of multiple agencies and therefore the supervision at the highest possible political level becomes absolutely important.\nThe Minister of Foreign Relations appreciated the deliberations of the Working Group to produce the Report in a short period of time given the situation concerning COVID-19 and stated that this report would be important at this juncture with regard to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for the Development.\nThe Working Group on 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was chaired by Ahmed A Jawad, Additional Secretary, Multilateral Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Relations and comprised Anton Perera Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister and Co-Secretary, Presidential Task Force for Economic Revival and Poverty Alleviation, Dr Lloyd Fernando, Member, Board of Studies Postgraduate Institute of Management, University of Sri Jayawardhanepura and Chairman, Gamani Corea Foundation, Dr C.S. Weerarathne, former Professor of Agriculture, University of Ruhuna and University of Rajarata and Chamindry Saparamadu, Attorney-at-Law/ Development Sector Professional and Lecturer in Sustainable Management.\nThe report underscores the importance of a strong institutional mechanism that could integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of Sustainable Development in a balanced, holistic and pragmatic manner across all levels of government and society and recommends creation of an institutional framework for effective coordination of the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals. One of the recommendations is that the composition of such a framework needs to cut across all sectors given the interconnected nature of the Sustainable Development Goals. Meaningful engagement of the businesses, academia, civil society, trade unions, women and youth as well as indigenous groups in the process of planning, target setting, implementation and monitoring has been identified as a critical factor underpinning success of implementation.\nThe report also emphasises that Sustainable Development Framework is a transformative Agenda which requires stewardship at the highest level having both convening power and the ability to foster multi-stakeholder engagement to transform it towards a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach and proposed number of actions for donor coordination, planning, SDG alignment, policy coherence, national SDG indicator framework, integrated monitoring and reporting mechanism, capacity building, use of alternate data sources, development of a financing framework, domestic resource mobilization, prioritise and support public sector innovation and establishment of a National Innovation Agency.\n\nMinistry of Foreign Relations\nColombo\n24 July 2020\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "57734159146c3264b748677d9b13ddf8"}

Mohan Peiris,\nPermanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations\nFriday, 29 January 2021\nGeneral Assembly Hall (in-person)\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President,\nNo doubt, a very optimistic view from a section of the human family who have successfully brought about this chaos. Ironically, the human race has also the ability to undo the chaos, although it may be at great cost. We however, cannot be jubilant about it or take credit for the recovery process. What is important, as much as the development of the vaccine is the establishment of a global order that would ensure for the human family a guarantee of non-recurrence of calamities of this nature. We cannot afford the luxury of another catastrophe of a similar nature that affects the human community.\n\nMr. President,\nSmall States like Sri Lanka have ungrudgingly accepted the burden of the MDGs and SDGs and are currently committed to achieving those goals by 2030. Acceleration of the implementation of sustainable solutions to overcome common development obstacles, including poverty and rising inequality, are crucial. A people centric policy and a programme of action to achieve these targets have been prepared by the Government of Sri Lanka towards this end. Poverty alleviation and an agri-based production economy is a major goal for the country.\nMr. President,\nWe are all aware that acts of terrorism, xenophobia, racism, intolerance, hate speech and disinformation are threats to international peace and security. They transcend boundaries and its prevention must be viewed as a collective responsibility by all. Sri Lanka, having faced terrorism for nearly 30 years, remains concerned by the unabated progression of terrorism in all its forms and manifestation, without an end in sight. It is only appropriate that we make the observation that those non-state actors who engage in unlawful activity should not be encouraged, in any way, or given the opportunity of justifying their activities at this august forum through any one of their sympathizers with a view to propagate their ideologies through the procedures established by the UN organization and its allied organs.\nRegrettably, this august body, as our worthy neighbor and friend India observed last evening, is yet to agree on a common definition of terrorism, and there remains a lack of progress towards a comprehensive convention against international terrorism. However, we remain optimistic and look forward to working with all Member States in addressing the challenges arising out of the many faces adorned by extremism and terrorism.\nWe note the reforms introduced both at Headquarters and throughout the United Nations system and reiterate the need for a more geographically diverse UN workforce sensitive to the different cultures that enriches the global community. It is essential to ensure that all actions taken by the system are transparent and in conjunction with adherence to and the implementation of the UN Charter. The UN must while addressing the challenges of our times, represent and reflect the interests of all Member States. Meaningful results on the ground at the national level, can only be ensured by seeking common ground which is the only sustainable path for addressing challenges in moving towards a more peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.\nMr. President,\n\nThank you.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "6535b26afc1f3dbaa6e41ad3b6c5461c"}

He said that the TNA is now called upon to discharge their responsibilities to the voters. The Minister recalled that some of the references in the TNA manifesto linked to sensitive political issues were unfortunate and underscored that the need of the hour is to exercise restraint and move towards reconciliation. He added that glorification through TNA statements of a terrorist leader who has been condemned worldwide for atrocities against humanity would not augur well to begin this journey of governance. He also said that the government is prepared to work with the newly elected Council and the political processes have now fully commenced.\n\nMinister Peiris further said that no other country which had undergone a similar traumatic experience has been required to restore everything within such a short span of time, and therefore Sri Lanka seeks a greater sense of objectivity from the UN. He regretted that the pressure from some members of the international community was a result of diaspora influence. The Minister stressed the importance of uniformity and consistency of the standards applied and the need to refrain from the use of selective criteria.\nDeputy Secretary-General Eliasson said that he understood the nature of challenges Sri Lanka is faced with, and acknowledged that changes cannot be made overnight given the country has undergone a protracted, traumatic war. He noted the progress made by Sri Lanka with regard to the implementation of recommendations of its domestic mechanism, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and added that establishing a Commission of Inquiry (CoI) was a positive development.

But though the flames have now been doused - the problems have only just begun. While there have been shipwrecks before, Sri Lanka has never faced one with such poisonous cargo.\nChairing the meeting, Actg. Additional Secretary, Ocean Affairs, Environment & Climate Change, Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake highlighted that, if there is to be any upside from this incident, it would be by serving as a catalyst for building a more resilient system to prevent and respond to maritime disasters in the future. This means prioritizing maritime emergency preparedness and management through development of a maritime disaster preparedness plan, strengthening the institutional basis for its implementation with adequate capacity building for the staff of relevant agencies.\nHigh Commissioner of Australia to Sri Lanka David Holly stated that, to achieve this, a collective initiative by the Government of Sri Lanka and its international friends and partners is needed. He expressed his appreciation to the government of Sri Lanka and in particular to the Foreign Ministry for coordinating this meeting as such coordination is pivotal to a successful outcome. The High Commissioner went on to state that to ensure that support is delivered efficiently, a mechanism needs to be setup for accepting and facilitating international assistance to avoid overlaps and that key gaps are left unaddressed.\n\n\n\nThe Foreign Ministry developed an initial working draft for a Maritime Disaster Preparedness Mechanism for Sri Lanka in September 2021, and has handed over the process to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping, which heads the Committee established to develop the said mechanism. The Committee is currently in the process of fine-tuning the mechanism together with the relevant stakeholders. Foreign Ministry is also working with stakeholders to bring the issue of marine pollution and immediate recovery to global level, particularly caused by plastic nurdles.\nForeign Ministry\nColombo\n\n\n\n..............................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..............................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "6694862046b73190a3f9f8a6d06415b0"}

The dialogue also saw discussions on the mutual challenges faced by all countries, with a commitment to share experience, expertise and assistance moving forward.\nSpeaking at the event, State Minister Balasuriya stressed that emerging from the current crisis requires a collective response, and called for nations to be 'partners' in navigating through the current situation.\nThe full statement delivered by the State Ministry Balasuriya during the video conference is as follows.\n\n\nIntroduction\nHis Excellency, Luo Zhaohui, Vice Foreign Minister of China and your Excellencies.\nAt the outset, let me start by commending the Chinese Foreign Ministry organizing this timely meeting on a very important topic\nSri Lanka, as a developing country of 22 million people has been able to effectively to contain the spread of the virus with limited resources and limited external assistance. As at today Sri Lanka has had 36 deaths and 14,000 Covid cases. All of them are either those who arrived from abroad or have been identified as belonging to a particular cluster.\n\nA National Strategy has adopted and is being constantly reviewed by the Task Force. A National Operation Center for Prevention of COVID-19 has also been setup to implement the strategy. This national strategy contains 04 main elements;\na. Identification of infected persons.\nb. Contact Tracing.\nc. Quarantining.\nd. Medical Treatment.\nAll identified patients are subjected to testing, and dedicated public hospitals have been established island-wide to treat Covid patients. Intermediate Care centers have been set up for asymptomatic Covid patients. Another aspect of our strategy is the very effective contact tracing method used by our security forces and intelligence agencies in identifying the infected persons and their contacts. Contacts of reported Covid cases are subject to home quarantine for 14 days and the Government has provided dry ration packs to these families. Sri Lankans returning from overseas are required to quarantine for 14 days at designated Quarantine Centers.\n\nAirports have remained closed and successful arrangements have been made to bring back Sri Lankans overseas, particularly migrant workers, students, as well as sick and elderly persons. Sri Lanka has so far repatriated over 44,000 (44,121) Sri Lankans from overseas and all of them were subjected to PCR tests and quarantine. The 67 Sri Lanka Missions abroad, in coordination with the Foreign Ministry, play a key role in registering Sri Lankans and repatriating them on priority basis.\n\nThe public have also effectively contributed by cooperating with the authorities and adhering to health guidelines. Several voluntary organizations raised funds and donated much needed medical equipment and protective gear.\nChallenges\nPrimary among the challenges that the government has to deal with is loss of employment, particularly workers in the informal sector and among low-income groups. The government is providing cost of living grants, concessionary loans, and have negotiated with banks and leasing companies to provide relief to the people. Programmes to distribute ration packs and a payment of a monthly allowance for families among low income groups have been implemented in areas under lockdown.\n\nThe Government has also provided relief measures to industries heavily affected by the pandemic, including the tourism and hospitality industry as well as Small and Medium Scale Enterprises.\nInternational Assistance\nSimilar to Sri Lanka, a large number of countries have also been severely affected by the onset of the pandemic. This includes the traditional donor community that usually supports Sri Lanka at a time of crisis. Therefore, during the course of the pandemic, external financial and material support to Sri Lanka has been limited. While Sri Lanka appreciates the support received from donor countries including China, which provided equipment and medical supplies, there remains a significant shortfall in resources in the wake of a second wave.\nAs the world looks on in hope following positive developments regarding a potential vaccine, we now settle in what is a new normal.\nHowever, the severe social and economic impacts of this pandemic are expected to be long lasting.\nThis is why, now more than ever, countries need to be partners that support each other in navigating the unchartered waters of the post-Covid world.\nIn this backdrop, it is vital that countries like Sri Lanka receive assistance\n\nin obtaining rapid testing equipment, ventilators and sharing of experiences in diagnostics, treatment and medicine.\nEarly access to a Vaccine that is affordable to developing Countries.\nCloser cooperation and sharing of experiences on border control, cross border transmission, containment measures at points of entry and emergency response.\nAssistance and sharing of experiences on economic recovery including debt relief.\nand\nCooperation to ensure smooth functioning of industrial and supply chains.\n\nWhile thanking the organizers for putting together this timely meeting that opens up a dialogue between our countries, I urge that we continue with this initiative to strengthen practical cooperation in fighting this pandemic and look forward to a world free of Covid in the near future.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "6ae13c3b36163d33a5d340163cb00c77"}

Tilak Marapana, PC., MP\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka\n\n\nAgenda item 2\n\nGeneva, 21 March 2018\n\n\nMr. President,\nMadam Deputy High Commissioner,\nDistinguished Delegates,\n\n\nMr. President,\nWe would like to express our sincere appreciation to the High Commissioner, the Deputy High Commissioner and the staff of the OHCHR for their consistent and constructive engagement with Sri Lanka, the invaluable technical support extended to us, and for their support and encouragement at all times.\nMr. President,\n\nWe are mindful, Mr. President, that the reconciliation, judicial and reparation processes are for all affected communities irrespective of race, religion, and gender, including the families of missing security forces personnel.\n\nMr. President,\n\nMr. President,\nA comprehensive list that demonstrates the progress Sri Lanka has made in the advancement and protection of human rights, reconciliation, and good governance since January 2015 to-date has been distributed to all members of the Council. I will therefore set out some of the most important steps we have taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we proceed on this important yet challenging journey, we are conscious of the need for the participation of all sections of our society to ensure that these important transformative steps through legislation and administrative means are well entrenched and duly institutionalised. Our firm commitment is reiterated to all stakeholders to reach consensus on a sustainable basis.\nThrough our firm resolve to ensure non-recurrence of conflict, we are committed to fulfilling the agenda on reconciliation. This agenda is unprecedented. We have undertaken to implement a vast agenda in a very short time. Such measures have taken most other countries, several decades to implement. Despite challenges, our commitment remains firm because we fully recognize that it is the duty of the State to all victims on all sides, to all communities and most of all to future generations to ensure that we lay the foundation for a stable, peaceful, reconciled and prosperous society. We recognise that we must not leave the burden of having to deal with the difficult legacy of our past, to our future generations.\nMr. President,\nAs a nation we are pained by the recent incidents in a few areas of Sri Lanka targeting members of the Muslim community who represent an integral part of the pluralistic society of Sri Lanka. Such acts which go against our shared vision of a Sri Lanka where equal rights and rule of law are guaranteed for all, have no place in a democratic, pluralistic society. The Government has taken swift action against perpetrators of these incidents and is investigating any lapses that may have taken place. Stringent measures will be initiated to ensure non-recurrence. A victim compensation programme has already commenced. We have reason to believe that certain interested parties were behind this, to tarnish our image at a time when this Council is in session.\nFollowing investigations, as it was discovered that social media and messaging platforms were being used not only to incite and spread hate and false messages but also to organise attacks, the Government was compelled to impose temporary restrictions on the use of social media. All these restrictions have now been lifted. The Government as a result of this experience has entered into active engagement with social media operators, to work with them on the prevention of hate speech. The emergency regulations which the Government was compelled to impose on 06 March 2018 as a measure to protect communities, were rescinded on 17 March 2018.\nMr. President,\nThe reconciliation and development agenda cannot be successfully achieved by Government working alone. The participation of political parties, civil society, academia, the business community, the media as well as the international community are essential for this important national endeavour.\nMr. President,\nWe would like to stress with sincerity and conviction that we will not be deterred by anyone in fulfilling the undertakings given by us to our people, which will lead to building a peaceful, stable, reconciled and prosperous Sri Lanka for all our citizens.\n\nMr. President,\nThe legacy of conflict in Sri Lanka is heavy, and it permeates our society to this day. Extremists constantly strive to take advantage of this situation to achieve political gain. This realization only makes us even more determined to ensure that we never return to the violent days of the past. It is our intention to ensure the fulfilment of our commitments to all our people and bring closure to a sad and disturbing period of our recent history.\n\n\nThank you.\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "70995be60f393e629292432eab671d63"}
{"title": "Repatriation of Sri Lankan Students from South Asia concludes", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nWith the arrival this evening (30 April) of UL 1188 carrying 125 Sri Lankan students from Kolkata, the operation to bring home 1065 Sri Lankan students based in the South Asian region, over 10 days, reached a successful conclusion.\n\nFollowing the analysis of data on the most vulnerable Overseas Sri Lankans wishing to return and the recommendation of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, on 14 April, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa instructed that students in South Asia be the first category to be repatriated following the closure of the airport for arrivals to Sri Lanka from abroad. The Ministry in close collaboration with the Sri Lanka Missions in South Asia, the Presidential Secretariat, the Coviod 19 Task Force and the Sri Lankan Airlines, and with strong assistance of the respective foreign governments ensured the safe return of the students stationed across many cities in the region, amidst numerous challenges posed by the complexities arising out of the global Pandemic.\nAs the first step, Sri Lanka Missions and Consulates General in South Asia, namely Dhaka, Kathmandu, New Delhi, Islamabad, Chennai, Mumbai and Karachi, undertook the collation of data of the students in their respective jurisdictions, thus building the necessary network with students and academic institutions to map out the repatriation process. The South Asia and SAARC Division of the Ministry of Foreign Relations headed by Director General Aruni Ranaraja coordinated the process with the Missions. A detailed plan for each destination, outlined in consultation with the Presidential Secretariat and the Presidential Task Force was executed including categorization and group formation, with the objective of streamlining both the repatriation and quarantine processes. This clustering of groups continued throughout the process of repatriation and will do so until the conclusion of the quarantine process.\nThe first repatriation on 21 April 2020, from Pakistan coordinated by the Sri Lanka High Commission in Islamabad led by Acting High Commissioner U.L. Niyas together with the Sri Lanka Consulate General in Karachi headed by G.L. Gnanatheva brought down a total of 106 persons, who were at 12 academic and training institutes across Pakistan, some located over 1500 Kms from the airport.\n\nThe Western Indian region repatriation was coordinated by the Sri Lanka Consulate General in Mumbai headed by Consul General Chamari Rodrigo and brought 164 persons from academic and training institutes in 15 cities in 05 States of Maharashtra, Gujrat, Goa, Madhya Paradesh and Karnataka.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Embassy in Kathmandu headed by Ambassador Himalee Arunatilaka repatriated 76 students from Kathmandu and Pokhara, which is around 200 km away from Kathmandu. Sri Lankan Airlines undertook the repatriation flight on 24 April 2020 to Kathmandu - a destination to which the national carrier does not have regular commercial flights.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Sri Lanka Missions in the South Asian region appreciates the cooperation extended by the Governments of Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, the state governments and the local authorities, Departments of Immigration, Authorities of Civil Aviation, academic institutes, the respective tri-forces of these countries, and Sri Lankan Organizations particularly the Mahabodhi Society in Kolkata, for providing unstinted cooperation and coordination to make the repatriation process a success.\nMinistry of Foreign Relations\nColombo\n\n30 April 2020\n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "709b4ee567973060908710ee948da8cf"}

Mohan Peiris,\nPermanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations\n08 March 2021 (virtual)\n\nWe have all heard many times and know for a fact that violations of human rights in most conflict affected communities, disproportionately affect women and children. In situations of heightened violence and insecurity, women are one of the most vulnerable segments of the population, they may even experience such violations from within the family itself, in addition to existing discrimination in society. We know that this has been exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, with over 20,000 Sri Lankan Peacekeepers, having served in UN Peace Missions across the world providing critical services to conflict affected communities in the most difficult and dangerous terrains, they are widely recognized for their valor and capabilities and appreciated by the UN Peacekeeping Missions they serve in. Over the years, Sri Lanka has consistently made efforts to encourage women peacekeepers and currently we have 12 women peacekeepers serving in South Sudan. We believe that women peacekeepers improve overall peacekeeping performance, have greater access to communities, help in promoting human rights and protection of civilians and encourage women to become a meaningful part of peace and political processes.\n\nWhile it is useful to share the experience among the international community on the obstacles faced by women and the prescriptions needed to alleviate from such setbacks, we must be sensitive to the diverse situations and circumstances, in which the proposed programs and strategies have to be implemented. The role of women in society is different in varied cultures and as such a one-size fits all policy cannot be applied in the pursuance of their rights. It is imperative for policies in this regard to be formulated, in tandem with domestic compulsions and requirements.\nMadam Chairperson, let us continue to remain cognizant of the invaluable contribution of women to the social, economic and political development of countries and reaffirm our commitment towards consistent and sustainable pro-equality and pro-empowerment policies for women conducive to the local contexts. As a global community we must not deter from this path and ensure that voices once unheard will be heard loud and clear.\nThank you.\n............................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...........................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "74a057df8f18372aa6a1b5c49ba8684e"}

Observing that regional platforms only provide a legal and policy framework, which would be redundant in the absence of practical action, he called for active programmes that encourage cooperation in the fields of security and technology ensuring that people can reap the maximum out of the dynamics and synergies of the region, while supporting sustainable growth.\n\n\n\nSince 2018, Sri Lanka has taken on the responsibility of being the Coordinator of the IORA Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security (IORA-WGMSS), bringing to it the experience of having faced numerous maritime security threats during the separatist terrorist conflict. The First Meeting of the group held in Colombo in August 2019, provided a platform to discuss shared priorities of Member States in the sphere of maritime safety and security, mainly focusing on tackling maritime criminal activities in the Indian Ocean, evolving maritime security challenges with existing maritime legal jurisprudence, drug trafficking, transnational crime and the global fishing industry. He said the Colombo meeting also finalized the draft WGMSS Work Plan in which 54 short term, ongoing and long-term projects were identified. It is encouraging to note that Member States have already taken up the responsibility as the lead country for the implementation of 16 projects with the assistance of the IORA Secretariat.\n\n\nAdditional Secretary/ Economic Affairs Mr. P.M.

This is a re-endorsement of the first mandate and a clear signal of their support for a path forward for the country, towards prosperity while safeguarding the people and protecting the sovereignty of the country without succumbing to any force.\n\nMadam President,\n\n\nMadam President,\n\nThe Policy Framework of the Government will be based on three main pillars of its vision for future, i.e. national security, friendly, non-aligned foreign policy and people-centric economic development.\nIn line with the above vision, a number of measures have been taken to uplift the rural economies, address socio-economic issues at ground level, including protecting the people against social evils such as organized crime and the drug menace, as follows:\n\n\nMadam President,\n\n\n\n\nMadam President,\n\nToday, Sri Lanka wishes to engage in a constructive discussion with this august assembly with the sincere hope that this Council would recognize the realities on the ground, and facilitate the required space for the GOSL to move forward with an inclusive approach within the provisions and parameters of the Constitution of the country, as explained to this Council during its 43rd Session. Sri Lanka would like to state further that the new Government which assumed office with the election of the new Parliament on 5 August remains committed to the assurances given before this Council in February this year.\nThe Government will look at deliverable measures of reconciliation as backed by the mandates given by the people, in the interest of Sri Lanka, instead of opting to continue with a framework driven externally that has failed to deliver genuine reconciliation for over four and half years.\nMadam President,\nAs mentioned by Hon. Foreign Minister during the 43rd Session of this Council, we hope the Council would appreciate the approach of the Government to achieve a sustainable peace through an inclusive, domestically designed and executed reconciliation and accountability process, that are in line with the interest of Sri Lanka and its people.\nThe Government will work towards addressing the outstanding concerns in a manner consistent with its voluntary obligations under the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, aimed at advancing individual and collective rights, ensuring justice and reconciliation, and addressing the concerns of vulnerable sections of the society, through due democratic and legal processes including institutional reform where necessary.\nMadam President,\nIt is noted that the Report fails to adequately and positively portray the significant progress achieved in respect of truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence since the visit of the Special Rapporteur and hence is not a reflection on the situation currently prevalent in Sri Lanka. Further it fails to note the progress made in promulgating legislation and the progressive steps taken by the Government of Sri Lanka to address truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence to all communities.\nIt is also noted that the report has failed to note the role of the Attorney General in a common law jurisdiction as opposed to a civil law jurisdiction and that the Attorney General is required to exercise powers, duties and functions within the parameters of the Constitutional and statutory mandate in terms of the law. In this context it must be noted that the Attorney General of Sri Lanka as the leader of the Bar and the highest Legal Officer of the State, has a duty to Court, to the State and to the subject to be wholly detached, wholly independent and to act impartially with the sole object of establishing the truth.\nAccordingly reference to the role of the Attorney General has been misconstrued and misconceived and the references made in the report to the Office of the Attorney General are without any justification or legal basis.\nMadam President,\n\nAt the same time, we consider it pertinent to caution this Council about certain segments who attempt to fabricate false narratives of intimidation and harassment by the State, which the Government of Sri Lanka has, of late, successfully disproved with solid evidence.\nWe also reiterate that, apart from operating routine security networks in the interest of national security, particular after the devastating Easter Sunday terrorist attacks, the Security Forces and intelligence agencies are not engaged in monitoring any specific group of people in the country. We believe for any country, compromising its national security interests amidst looming sophistication of strategies of radical and extreme elements world around, is bound to face regrettable consequences. Hence, the GoSL requests all parties to be mindful of that ground reality in this context.\nIn conclusion, the Government of Sri Lanka will continue its engagement with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Human Rights mechanisms, and work in close cooperation with the international community, in keeping with domestic priorities and policies.\nThank you.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "7851b8b071683867bb4bab1150b14d5c"}

Tilak Marapana, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Parliament regarding the concerns raised over the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the freedom of assembly and of association", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nSince many a view had been expressed by Hon. Members of Parliament leading to considerable confusion, I wish to place before you the following:\n\nThe visit of the Special Rapporteur on the freedom of assembly and of association which is currently underway is part of similar visits undertaken by UN Special Procedures Mandate Holders at the invitation of the Government of Sri Lanka.\n\n\nThe idea of welcoming such visits is to have a transparent process in place whereby the Government of Sri Lanka hopes to engage with the international community, including the UN, in a spirit of openness and dialogue.\n\n\nThis is not the first time that we have had a visit of a Special Rapporteur; there have been 08 such visits which have taken place since 8 January 2015. In all such occasions, it has been the regular practice for the Foreign Ministry to coordinate the activities of the SR in Sri Lanka and to arrange meetings with the Government sector. Before each such visit is undertaken, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs routinely receives from the UN, a list of persons that the visiting Special Rapporteur wishes to meet.\n\n\nWith respect to the current visit by the Special Rapporteur which is in question, it is important to note that as with other such visits, the Ministry convened a preparatory meeting of stakeholders to discuss arrangements. Thereafter, the Ministry writes to the relevant institutions, conveying the request for formal appointments by the Special Rapporteur. In this instance, the same procedure was followed, including with respect to over 20 meetings sought, including with the Hon. Chief Justice and Hon. Judges of the Colombo High Court.\n\n\n\nIt was in this backdrop that the Actg. Secretary/ Foreign Affairs, addressed the letter to Secretary/ Ministry of Justice, Secretary/ Ministry of Defence and Hon. Attorney General, mentioning the cases. The purpose was to alert these institutions on the possibility of the Special Rapporteur raising issues regarding the particular cases.\n\n\nIt would be noted from the letter from Actg. Secretary/ Foreign Affairs that nowhere has it been recommended that the appointment sought with Hon. Chief Justice and Hon. Judges of the High Court in Colombo be granted.The letter only conveyed the wish of the Special Rapporteur for these appointments.\n\n\nSimilarly, nowhere in the Foreign Ministry letter it is stated that the cases will be discussed, but only alerted the institutions concerned that it may be discussed. This was consequent to the stakeholder meeting held on 5 July before the visit took place.\n\n\nThe Foreign Ministry has followed proper procedure by communicating the requests for meetings by the Special Rapporteur through the Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Services Commission. The Judicial Services Commission having considered the Ministry letter consulted the Hon. Chief Justice who granted the appointment.\n\n\n\nAgain I wish to emphasize that this is not the first time that the Foreign Ministry has taken the course of action that it has taken for this particular visit. In fact two previous Foreign Secretaries have requested similar meetings in June 2017 and October 2017 by writing directly to the Office of Hon. Chief Justice. However, in this instance, the Foreign Ministry had only conveyed the request of the Special Rapporteur to the Secretary/Ministry of Justice.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to highlight that during the visits of special procedures mandate holders, this Ministry has always worked with all relevant line agencies in Sri Lanka in a spirit of consultation and engagement.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "7c843ee23a73309084490b2a0393746d"}

Its tasks are to: ensure the proper functioning and implementation of the Agreement; set priorities; and make recommendations. \nAll three Working Groups established under the terms of the Joint Commission reported back from their respective meetings held in January (the Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights) and in May (the Working Group on Trade and Economic Cooperation Issues, and the Working Group on Development Cooperation).\n\nThe parties welcomed the recent lifting of the EU ban on export of fish from Sri Lanka. This was achieved due to the extensive improvements made by the Government of Sri Lanka in fisheries management and control, consistent with its international obligations. It was agreed that the close relationship established on fisheries between the two parties will continue.\nThe meeting provided an opportunity to exchange views on the state of implementation of the UN Human Rights Council resolution of 1 October 2015, which was co-sponsored by a number of UN Member States and Sri Lanka. The parties noted the progress made and indicated that further measures would be pursued and progress would continue for the implementation of the resolution. Progress with regard to the release of land and the normalisation of the life in the North and East of the country, the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the release or prosecution of detainees held under the PTA, and the establishment of the transitional mechanisms for truth, reconciliation, justice and reparations were also discussed. Sri Lanka provided updates on the process of drawing up the new Constitution.\nThe Joint Commission welcomed Sri Lanka's application for access to the trade concessions under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) as a sign of Sri Lanka's renewed commitment to meeting its wider international obligations. The parties discussed the procedure for assessing the application, which was presented to the EU at the end of June, in line with the GSP Regulation. The EU drew attention to the importance of continued positive progress in fulfilling Sri Lanka's stated commitments which need to proceed in parallel. The Joint Commission also agreed to resume the EU-Sri Lanka investment dialogue.\n\nThe EU welcomed the participation of Sri Lankan students, scholars and universities in EU higher education and research cooperation programmes and encouraged more applications from Sri Lanka, given the wealth of available opportunities.\nThe parties agreed on a series of actions for follow-up before the next Joint Commission meeting in Colombo in 2017.\n\n(Word Doc) (PDF)\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "7ca17216bf213695b5ece145272b92dc"}

{"title": "Speech by the Hon. Foreign Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris in Parliament, 5 October 2021", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nMr. Speaker,\nI rise today to inform this House of our efforts in the international sphere on behalf of Sri Lanka. While we, as a government, are combatting the current pandemic and dealing with the consequences of economic contraction due to its worst effects, I would like, with your permission, to highlight another aspect of our approach to governance and national wellbeing. At a policy level, we must stress our President's commitment to full, candid and open engagement with fellow nation states. Our vistas of prosperity and well-being cannot be achieved in isolation. We all share a common future and owe it to succeeding generations to do the best we can to secure and guarantee that brighter future.\n\n\n\nHis Excellency President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in his statement at the 76th UN General Assembly in New York, stated that Sri Lanka is fully engaged with international partners in order to combat the pandemic and the consequent economic fallout as well as existential crises resulting from climate change. Our engagement is aimed at safeguarding our people from the worst effects of these global challenges.\nEqually importantly for Sri Lanka, these visits provided us with the opportunity to address the international community at bilateral and multilateral levels regarding recent domestic developments and difficulties we have faced in Sri Lanka on critical national issues related to human rights and reconciliation and to correct any inaccurate or biased perceptions.\nI concluded my statement to the Human Rights Council in Geneva by stating that:\n\"We are open in acknowledging our challenges and, as a responsible and democratic government, we are committed to achieving tangible progress on the entire range of issues relating to accountability, reconciliation, human rights, peace and sustainable development.\"\nWe have taken the position that we do recognise the need to address these challenges and, in that effort, we need to be open and responsive to constructive criticism and international overtures made in good faith. That being said, Mr Speaker, we do not need to compromise our independence, national sovereignty nor our self-respect as a nation.\nI myself had the opportunity to personally discuss with Foreign Ministers of a number of key countries, as well as address gatherings which are of direct relevance in Sri Lanka such as the Commonwealth, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Community of Democracies and the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Our continued and vigorous efforts to place on record our experience, perceptions and position demonstrates this approach of openness, candour and willingness to engage. We reaffirmed our commitment to democratic norms, ideals and commonly shared values from the standpoint of a nation consistently adhering to this system for nine decades; as one of the oldest representative democracies in Asia.\n\nSri Lanka needs to participate in this dialogue with the international community in resolving these fundamental issues. What is also clear is that we need to reach out to a very broad range of stakeholders domestically and internationally such as scientists, economists, the private sector, leaders in technology, youth as well as primary producers of food. This represents a cross-section of the local and global community, at various levels and across diverse fields of endeavour. As His Excellency the President stated, \"The economic impact of the pandemic has been especially severe on developing countries. This has placed the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals at considerable risk.\"\nThis, Mr Speaker, is the great challenge that faces us collectively. It is no empty nor idle boast to state that Sri Lanka has taken leadership in critical spheres and is at the helm of some key aspects of environmental activism. As a country vulnerable to extremes of climatic change, our forthcoming engagement at the COP26 in the United Kingdom will only underline our commitment to our common, interdependent future.\nRegarding climate change, for instance, we owe it to ourselves, to the young and to the future generations of our people, to reverse the shortcomings of the past and to repair and rebuild a healthy planet. In this effort, we have joined hands in solidarity with the rest of the world and our President announced our position at the UN General Assembly as well as at the High-Level Dialogue on Energy.\n\nHe stated that Sri Lanka has contributed to these global efforts through the Colombo Declaration on Sustainable Nitrogen Management and our recognition as a Commonwealth Blue Charter Champion. We have pledged to join global efforts to become a carbon neutral country by 2050 and to obtain 70% of our energy resources from renewable sources by 2030. Our domestic efforts to promote sustainable agriculture, increase forest cover and to combat water and plastic pollution were generally welcomed.\nOur presence internationally and at the General Assembly was vital, because in order to reach these ambitious targets, in the years to come, we need to have significant access to technology, financial cooperation and assistance. We will reiterate these messages at COP 26 later this year.\nMr Speaker, the other great challenge we need to overcome is that of social cohesion and unity. In the absence of a truly integrated nation devoid of internecine strife, bitterness and rancour, we need to build bridges rather than walls. We need to reach out to all segments of society and repay the trust and confidence placed in the government at successive elections in 2019 and 2020. In my statement to the UN Human Rights Council in September I referred to our initiatives to reinvigorate and resuscitate national efforts to promote reconciliation - sorely needed after a protracted conflict. As President Rajapaksa said in New York:\n\"Fostering greater accountability, restorative justice, and meaningful reconciliation through domestic institutions is essential to achieve lasting peace.\"\n\n\nOur message, through you, Mr Speaker, to the nation and the world is that we seek to celebrate our diversity while forging a sense of oneness - a Sri Lankan consciousness and identity - that will be a source of strength rather than weakness as we address the several local and global challenges.\nAs the Prime Minister said in his address in Bologna: \"Reconciliation is a critical need of our time. Conflicts and escalating tensions are all too evident around us. Peace and stability come from healthy relationships with all who live in our countries, including those with whom we have deep disagreements. Here, again, our religion teaches us that hatred is not conquered by hatred but by love alone. Rather than dwell on grievances derived from the past, we must focus on the present, the need for harmony with points of view different from our own, and the inspiring new frontier which awaits us all if we forge the urgently needed links of brotherhood and understanding.\"\nI wish, in passing, to stress the role of civil society in these efforts. Representatives of civil society are an integral part of the solutions we wish to devise. They are, Mr Speaker, not a manifestation of the problem but an essential component of the resolution of our problems. There have been concerns raised about the supposed government initiatives to stifle NGO activities in Sri Lanka. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are actively engaged with the community and are seeking to harness their capabilities and undoubted capacity in support of reconciliation and with regard to SDG16 processes. I stated this quite clearly in my address to the Human Rights Council in Geneva and I want to assure this House that we consider them a valuable and a valued partner in our efforts for the betterment of our people.\n\nAs President Rajapaksa stressed in his address to the UNGA:\n\"Terrorism is a global challenge that requires international cooperation, especially on matters such as intelligence sharing, if it is to be overcome. Violence robbed Sri Lanka of thousands of lives and decades of prosperity in the past half century.\nMy Government is committed to ensuring that such violence never takes place in Sri Lanka again.\nWe are therefore acting to address the core issues behind it.\"\nIn conclusion, Mr Speaker, I wish to reassure the people of Sri Lanka that we will not rest in our efforts to garner the best outcomes for the nation through continued, proactive engagement with the international community. I will endeavour, in the coming months, to regularly inform the Hon Members of the House and the nation at large of our endeavours in this regard.\nI thank you, Mr Speaker.\n.....................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "87e5677774493a64ba4aa8f70adb0fb0"}

We were reminded that we are fighting a common adversary in terrorism, and its associated manifestations of radicalization and violent extremism, which had taken many innocent lives from across many parts of the world in recent times.\nIn this context, it is quite insensitive and ill-conceived that you did not consider it important to share your concerns with the Sri Lankan government first, before going public with your statement. This would have also been in keeping with the key objectives of your respective mandates, i.e. to provide early warning and advocacy. We are particularly disappointed that your statement comes at a time when Sri Lanka has been following a well-acknowledged open and constructive engagement with the UN System and its human rights mechanism, including with the special procedures and mandate holders for the past several years. Eight such Special Procedures have visited Sri Lanka in the last four years which ranked among a handful of countries with regard to accommodating such engagement. In this context and spirit, we would have welcomed any constructive criticism or observation from your offices as well. Your prejudiced action only serves to sensationalize issues at a time the government is taking stringent measures to maintain law and order and quell unrest in the interest of safety of all.\n\n\nThe almost two and half million Muslims who comprise about 10% of the 22 million population of Sri Lanka have lived in harmony amongst the Buddhist majority (over 70%) and other groups for over several centuries. Even amidst the gravest provocations during the 30 years separatist terrorist armed conflict in Sri Lanka, where sacred Buddhist and Islamic religious places were attacked and devotees butchered, religion has not been a cause for violence. Hence, the above statement skews the situation on the ground and interprets post-April 21 events through a narrow prism of stereotypical labels, while disregarding the deeper and more nuanced issues at play.\n\n\n\nWe seek your understanding and support at this difficult time for our country and all its people.\nYours sincerely,\nDr. Rohan Perera\nAmbassador/Permanent Representative\nEnd Text \n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nColombo\n\n24 May 2019\n--------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "8d2b30bc07e23ea7ad545eeae3ec96b9"}

The Minister remarked that every endeavour should be made to ensure that the purest motives of the Catholic Church are not hijacked, either locally or internationally.\nWhile expressing his sincere appreciation for the attention being received by the Catholic Church and Catholics in Sri Lanka, though they are a minority, the Papal Nuncio indicated that he has not witnessed similar recognition given to Catholics in other countries.\n\n\nThe Apostolic Nuncio wished the Minister of Foreign Affairs every success in his new assignment.\nForeign Ministry\nColombo\n01 September, 2021\n\n\n..................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "8d31b46d4be73ccd88bedf2a10cd918b"}

Deputy Minister follows below\n\n\nLeader of the Delegation of Sri Lanka to the \nConference of States Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption\n3 November 2015, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation\n\nMr. President, \nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAt the outset, let me convey to the President and the Government of the Russian Federation the warmest greetings from the Government and people of Sri Lanka and at the same time our condolences to families of those who perished in the terrible tragedy last Saturday. I extend my sincere congratulations, Mr. President, on your election as the Chair of this important conference and wish you all success.\nLet me take this opportunity to pay special compliments to the Government of the Russian Federation for the excellent hosting arrangements for this Conference. Our felicitations also go to other members of the Bureau and the Secretary to the Conference and the staff of the Secretariat.\nMr. President,\n\nThis also includes in particular the obligations that Sri Lanka has assumed as a State Party to the UN Convention against Corruption.\nIn fulfilment of the mandate received at both the Presidential and parliamentary elections, the Government has taken a host of meaningful steps to ensure that the public service remains free of corruption and service delivery is carried out effectively, independently and with integrity. \nMr. President, \n\nCurrently, investigations into allegations of bribery, corruption and money laundering are being proactively pursued by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption, the Financial Crimes Investigation Division and the Criminal Investigation Department. The Presidential Task Force on Stolen Assets Recovery was also established to recover stolen assets belonging to the State. The Government of Sri Lanka is also encouraging the participation of civil society and businesses to assist in curbing corruption. In a country where the pursuit of anti-corruption measures was only a rhetorical commitment under the last Government, the number and scale of anti-corruption efforts and mechanisms in place today undoubtedly represents a paradigm shift.\nWith all these measures taken, the Government and the people of Sri Lanka are justifiably proud that the ongoing drive against corruption continues unabated at all levels so that, in a corruption free environment, Sri Lanka will realize the full potential of economic advancement, consistent with SDG16 that calls for an inclusive society with access to justice.\n\n\nMr. President, \n\nBefore I conclude let me state here that we are positively considering to host the 8th session of the Conference in beautiful and sunny Sri Lanka in 2019.\nI thank you Mr. President\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "8e12042b8fde3ce58e47c13477db7cf9"}

This meeting represents a positive step towards addressing the important issue of Nitrogen Management ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, hosted by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland later this year.\nSustainable environmental policies require not only environmental conservation but also improving social and economic practices so that nations can sustain their people and their natural environments in the long term.\nFor its part, the Government of Sri Lanka has adopted balanced policies that promote the sustainability of our biodiversity, forest cover, waterways and oceanic resources alongside the socioeconomic requirements of our citizens. Inculcating a sense of environmental sensitivity and responsibility amongst our future generations is critically important and is included in our ongoing educational reforms.\nAt the Biodiversity Summit of the United Nations General Assembly last year, I made an appeal to world leaders for the better management of Nitrogen. Climate scientists have been studying and grappling with the impact of increased Carbon Dioxide emissions in the atmosphere for decades. I believe it is important to address the issue of Nitrogen waste in a similarly urgent way, and to broaden the ongoing discourse on climate change accordingly.\nWith agriculture comprising the primary means of livelihood for a significant section of our population, the issue of nitrogen management is particularly important to Sri Lanka. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the Nitrogen fertilizer used domestically is wasted, and ends up in the atmosphere, land, and water. Transportation and other industries also release gaseous reactive Nitrogen, which entraps heat and contributes to faster global warming.\nI am aware that such issues are common to countries in our region, and that the adverse consequences of these issues will prove challenging to our Governments in the medium and long term. Improved Nitrogen management through comprehensive study, more awareness building and creating better solutions for the dual imperatives of sustaining economic activity and the environment is therefore of critical importance. Such actions need to be guided by timely policy decisions not just at the national level, but also regionally and globally.\nI am confident that the deliberation of this forum will help bring together the Governments of the South Asian region towards a common understanding on this issue. This will in turn have a positive impact on the decisions arrived at during the 26th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change later this year. In concluding, I convey my best wishes to you for a successful and productive forum.\nThank you.\n......................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..............................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "9b606cc854bd3e46879d487b791c4ef1"}

{"title": "Speech by Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena at Stakeholder Dialogue on Climate Change, Resilience & Just Recovery in the Sectors of Agriculture, Forestry & Biodiversity", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nMembers of the Head Table,\nYour Excellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nFirstly at the outset I would like to thank SLYCAN Trust and other stake holders for inviting me to address this important event, and also we thank the agencies, especially the German Federal Ministry and other agencies that are participating and assisting at this dialogue today.\nClimate change has become the biggest threat to the global existence of humankind. It is important that we take collective action to build climate resilience at the local, national and global level.\nWhile Sri Lanka is focusing on addressing climate change impacts at local and national level, through existing mechanisms, we also continue our engagement and commitment to global action ever since climate change started gaining international traction, through various initiatives.\nSri Lanka is among the countries that focused on loss and damage in their Nationally Determined Contributions since the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions stage, and continues to focus on addressing climate risks and risk management through risk transfer mechanisms, as well as setting up national mechanism to facilitate the work related to the areas of the Warsaw International Mechanism under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nSince the ratification of the UNFCCC, in 1993, and the Paris Agreement in 2016, we, as a country have made commitments focusing on key sectors and taking affirmative actions to address the impacts of climate change. We have been contributing to ensure that we build climate resilience at national level, while working with the international community to contribute to the global efforts to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change.\nIn working towards climate action, it is important for us to also achieve sustainable development and at how resilience could be built through inclusive and participatory processes, integrate stakeholder driven decision making processes and implementation of climate action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs our climate changes and the planet becomes warmer, the plastic breaks down into more methane and ethylene, increasing the rate of climate change, and so perpetuating the cycle. To reduce such impacts, among others, on March 31st 2021, Sri Lanka took legislative measures to ban a number of single use plastics, while working on introducing eco-friendly alternatives.\nYou may recall it was in 2001 as Minister of Environment I chaired the Ozone Summit in Sri Lanka and the Colombo Declaration was adopted unanimously at that international summit, which was a prelude to the climate actions we also adopted Rain Water Policy Framework declared during the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, mainly because of dedicated and knowledgeable minds that gave this contribution.\n\nSri Lanka believes that climate financing commitments under UNFCCC and other mechanisms are needed for developing economies such as Sri Lanka to build resilience and address the adverse effects of climate change and to undertake potential greenhouse gas emission reduction initiatives.\nYour Excellencies, dear friends - I call upon you to embark on getting more, and if possible, all young men and women to harvest and harness more rainwater and solar energy. Both are in abundance and blessed in Sri Lanka.\nAs world renowned scientist of Sri Lanka Prof. Senanayake points out we have to cut back on unwanted and wasteful emissions. As Buddhist we are taught to be content. Thus, for our own selves and collectively at large for all beings.\n\nAnd we must both protect and contribute to the growth of our flora and fauna, especially what was passed down unto us by our forefathers, as we mention in Sri Lanka for all living beings. This is the message encapsulated in the teachings of Buddha.\nFinally before concluding I would like to mention that I myself have proposed that environment, forests, rivers, water and clean air be fundamental rights in our new constitution. I hope all of us could work towards such important areas to a new future.\n\nAyubowan.\n\n\n..................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "9ce1e3f97e7c3703aee890621e1b1d00"}
{"title": "\u200b49th session of the Human Rights Council\u00a0High Level Segment Statement by Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nMr. President,\nSri Lanka is an active participant in the multilateral framework to realize the promotion and protection of human rights.\nFundamental rights are embodied in our Constitution, progressively advanced through our democratically elected organs of government and enforced through our independent judiciary. Despite multiple challenges we have faced from terrorism, we have restored peace, security and the rule of law throughout the country. Our democratic traditions and independent institutions ensure free and fair elections at regular intervals through universal adult franchise. We will further advance the considerable progress we have made in post-conflict recovery and healing. For this, we have put in place domestic institutions for reconciliation, accountability and social justice.\n\nThrough this cooperative interaction, and in line with our domestic framework and international obligations, we continue to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights and social justice for all our citizens, irrespective of ethnic and religious identity and political affiliation.\nMr. President,\n\nAs a developing Member State of the international community, we brace ourselves to face the further adverse economic consequences of crises, such as the pandemic and the unravelling conflict in Europe, which will impact on our efforts to achieve the SDGs.\nMr. President,\nWe are today in a period of review of the work of the Council. We reflect on whether the Council has been successful in overcoming the credibility gap that led to the downfall of its predecessor Commission.\nThe multilateral architecture for the implementation of human rights was progressively developed in the last decades. Consensus was forged on key principles which we consider sacrosanct, such as that the promotion and protection of human rights should be guided by the principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, based on the sovereign equality of Member States. UNGA resolution 60/251 and HRC resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 also decided that the working methods of the Council shall be transparent, fair and impartial, and shall enable genuine dialogue.\n\nMr. President,\nMember States have mandated this Council and its Secretariat with a truly extensive array of helpful working methods to assist Governments in the promotion and protection of human rights. Sri Lanka has participated actively and constructively in those aspects of the Council's work that have been productive and beneficial, and which have helped to ensure that our people live safer, longer, and more dignified lives. We reject those that are punitive, politicized, divisive, unhelpful and initiated due to extraneous reasons.\nMr. President,\nAs elsewhere in the world, we endeavor to strike a just balance between human rights and national security when dealing with terrorism. Sri Lanka is convinced that counter-terrorism legislation must secure and protect the rights of persons subject to investigation detention and trial, and must not restrict democratic freedoms such as the freedom of expression. With these objectives in view, I recently presented a Bill in the Parliament of Sri Lanka which is an initial step in amending the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 43 years after it was promulgated.\nWe take particular objection to the use of voluntary funding which has the necessary consequence of undermining objectivity and detachment. Against this background, Sri Lanka once again reiterates its view that the evidence gathering mechanism established under OP 6 of resolution 46/1 is unhelpful to the people of Sri Lanka, will polarize Sri Lankan society, and adversely affect economic development, peace and harmony at a challenging time. It is an unproductive drain on Member State resources, at a time of severe financial shortfalls across the entire multilateral system including the High Commissioner's Office.\nMr. President,\n\nThank you.\n\n\n....................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n....................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "9d0f479c775a30e8aa4aacfa8c9b50bc"}

He was a brilliant lawyer, a skilled orator and a courageous human rights advocate. His passion for the law led him to become one of Sri Lanka's most successful and respected legal minds. He served as Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister from 1994 to 2005. He was a man of exceptional talent, courage and vision and I had the privilege of serving as a diplomat during his tenure as Foreign Minister.\nA few minutes would hardly be sufficient to speak of his remarkable life, and I have no doubt that all of you are well versed on his achievements be it academic, political or in the field of sport. Therefore, today I want to reflect on how his commitment towards peace, justice, human rights and the fight against terrorism changed the course of Sri Lankan history.\n\n\n\n\nHis firm conviction that the only way forward for Sri Lanka was the ensuring of unity, compassion and human dignity has stood the test of time. A lot of work was done in the aftermath of the conflict to repair what was so badly damaged - we took the children out of the battlefield and put them in classrooms.

{"title": "Foreign Minister Samaraweera speaks at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington", "date": "date", "content": "\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nFull Statement\n\nSri Lanka after the Presidential Election: \n\nat the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\nFebruary 11th 2015\n\n\n\n\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, \nThe story that I have to tell you today is a happy one. A story that shows, that although Sri Lanka and this great country are situated far away from each other, and our nations are unequal in size, there is much that binds the people of our two nations. Their commitment to democracy, freedom, liberty, good governance and the rule of law and their dedication to uphold, protect and preserve the pluralistic nature of society. These are the values which the people of Sri Lanka chose to reaffirm at the Presidential election held just over 33 days ago when they used the power of the ballot to elect Mr. Maithripala Sirisena as their President.\n\nOver 81.52% of registered voters exercised their franchise on 8th January, silently, peacefully and decisively resulting in a swift transfer of power the very next day. The firm resolve of the Army Commander, Inspector General of Police, and the Attorney General must also be commended in the face of moves to declare a state of emergency and disrupt the counting in the early hours of 9th January.\nThe people of Sri Lanka, through this singular act, conveyed several powerful messages:\n-reaffirming their faith in the best traditions of democracy, they showed how formidable a power elections can prove to be; \n\n-they also sought through this election to set standards for their leaders to abide by. Calling for an end to impunity and corruption, people demanded that their elected leaders and public officials are made accountable for their actions and inactions.\n\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\n\nFollowing the election, President Sirisena was appointed as Chairperson of the party that was earlier headed by the former President, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Although this phenomenon may have seemed strange to observers of Sri Lankan affairs, this act made it possible for the President and the Government to secure the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom party which has a majority in Parliament. Working together with so many different partners is a new experience for us which requires the Government to chart its path carefully and mindfully, through consensus building. It is nevertheless, a necessary path to tread to implement the important 100 Day Work Programme or Reform Agenda of the Government which has been endorsed by the people, enact key legislation required for this purpose and take important steps required to heal the wounds of our nation.\n\n\n\n-paying respects to all the citizens of Sri Lanka, of all ethnicities and religions who lost their lives due to the tragic conflict that afflicted the country for over three decades and to all the victims of violence since Independence, and \n\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\n\n\n\n\n-Restrictions placed on persons visiting the North were lifted with immediate effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Delivering on the assurance that the passage of the Assistance and Protection to Victims and Witnesses Bill will be expedited, action is to be taken on this matter in Parliament this month.\n-Introduction of an ethical Code of Conduct for all representatives of the people, the enactment of the Right to Information Act, and the National Audit Act are also currently being worked on for implementation within 100 days.\n-A National Executive Council inclusive of representatives of parties represented in Parliament has been set up and meets regularly for consultations on the implementation of the 100 Day Programme and issues of national importance. Parties that are not a part of the Government such as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) are also represented in this National Executive Council.\n-On 20th January, the Prime Minister gave an assurance in Parliament that the 13th amendment to the Constitution will be implemented. This will be done while ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State.\n-Compliance with applicable legal provisions pertaining to the arrest and detention of persons will be enforced and the possibilities of working with international partners, particularly the ICRC in providing access to detainees and in the establishment of a comprehensive database will be explored.\n-A vote on account to provide certain relief measures to the public was presented to Parliament as pledged on 29th January and adopted by a majority of 163 votes on 7th February.\n\n\nI am sure you are all eager to find out about issues of accountability in relation to the conflict that plagued Sri Lanka for several decades. What President Sirisena pledged under item 93 of the 100 Day Programme in this respect is to ensure justice with regard to such matters through national independent judicial mechanisms. Although the Government has only just completed 30 days in office, this matter has already received due consideration and has undergone detailed discussion signifying the importance accorded to this issue that is a vital component of the healing process of our nation. As you know, the Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation too, in addressing issues of accountability, identified a series of incidents which warrant further investigation and if the material so warrants, the institution of prosecutions.\nAccordingly, steps will be taken in the coming weeks to begin the process of setting up necessary mechanisms to investigate into incidents, and where sufficient evidence is available, conduct criminal prosecution in such cases. We will engage with the international community in this process including the United Nations and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nThe Government will also explore ways and means to harness the potential of the Sri Lankan diaspora to contribute to local reconciliation and development efforts.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was therefore uncharacteristic for Sri Lanka to have shifted away from this traditional foreign policy for some years in what is best described as an aberration. Sri Lanka now seeks to renew its engagement with the world community. Just before my departure to London on Saturday evening, I signed a letter inviting the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Sri Lanka.\nI look forward to inviting the Secretary of State when I meet him tomorrow, to visit Sri Lanka as well. I will also invite the UN Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon to visit Sri Lanka when I meet him on Friday. Shooting at the moon, we would also like to see the President of the United States of America visiting Sri Lanka. If it were to happen, it would be the first visit by an American President since Sri Lanka achieved independence in 1948.\n\nThe Government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremasinghe, therefore, pursue a policy of renewed engagement with the international community. We look at the world as an opportunity and not as a threat. We will embrace the world so as to get the best the world can offer for the betterment of the Sri Lankan people. Ours will be a pragmatic foreign policy not based on ideology but on the needs of our people.\n\nI would like to quote in this context from a recent article written by the moderator of this event Mr. Fredric Grare that was published in the Carnegie portal this month. In this post-election analysis he suggests and I quote:\n\nunquote \n\n\n\n\nI would like to leave with you some thoughts on how the world at large including all of you as individuals could help Sri Lanka at this unique moment of its history.\nFirst, I invite all of you to visit us. Join this exciting moment of our history and carry our story out to the world. \n\nThird, I urge the international community including the human rights community to be patient. This is a time of fragile transition. The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to the success of this journey of strengthening democracy, good governance and the rule of law while ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights of all her citizens.\nBut remember, this is also a sensitive process involving the participation of a multitude of political parties that are essential to ensure the success of this journey.

Tilak Marapana, PC., MP\nMinister of Foreign Affairs\n\nConsideration of the Appropriations Bill 2019\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n26th March 2019\n\nHon. Speaker,\n\n\n\n\n Re-structuring of the Foreign Ministry and Missions Abroad\n\n\n\n\nRecruitment, training, posting and promotion are also a matter of concern. While the Sri Lanka Foreign Service (SLFS) has an approved cadre of 261 we have only 188 officers at present. Systematic and regular recruitment is needed in order for the Foreign Ministry to function effectively. The 2018 Intake to the Sri Lanka Foreign Service (SLFS) consisting of 20 Officers assumed duties on 2nd May 2018.\nAs the Ministry strives to enhance the professionalism of its cadres, especially of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service, it is also important that we ensure the primacy of the professional Sri Lanka Foreign Service officers in appointments to missions abroad. In this context, the disparity between career Foreign Service officers and those politically appointed to Sri Lanka Missions abroad is being addressed.\n\n\n\n Consular Affairs\n\n\nOne of the most important interfaces of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the general public is its Consular Affairs Division. In order for the Ministry to provide better and more efficient consular services, a new digital system was introduced in early 2017 that provided fully automated, prompt and efficient as well as interactive services to the public. The Ministry also implemented programmes aimed at improving the consular services provided through the Sri Lanka Missions abroad especially to migrant workers and their families. The Ministry opened its second regional consular office in Matara in February 2019. This follows a similar office being established in Jaffna in 2017.\nIntegrated Consular Mobile Services (ICMS) have been conducted in Kilinochchi and Mannar. The signing of a MOU with the Ministry of Home Affairs on 16 August 2018, has decentralized the document attestation process offering this service at divisional secretariats.\nOur Missions are also embarking on a fast track approach in facilitating the issuance of new passports availing of a courier service, conscious that delays in receiving these documents could lead to loss of job and other opportunities for Sri Lankans abroad. Presently this is being operationalized as a pilot project through our Consulate General in Dubai.\n\n\n Relations with the UN and other Multilateral and Regional Organizations\n\n\nSri Lanka remains a strong proponent of multilateralism, within the United Nations and as an active member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the Commonwealth, the G-77, other multilateral fora. Our active engagement with regional bodies such as the European Union, the Commonwealth, SAARC, BIMSTEC, ASEAN, IORA, Bali Process, Asia Cooperation Dialogue, and Shanghai Cooperation Organization, among others, has demonstrated the transparent and constructive engagement of the Government through its foreign relations at all levels. Sri Lanka is currently chair of BIMSTEC, the lead coordinator of the Maritime Safety and Security Pillar of IORA, has obtained full membership of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in August 2018, and efforts are being made to obtain Sectoral Dialogue Member Status with ASEAN.\n\nWith regard to promoting development in the fields of Science and Technology, the Ministry has played a pivotal role in coordinating WIPO and CERN.\nTaking note of the important contribution that our migrant workers make to the national budget, the Ministry through its Permanent Missions in Geneva and New York was actively involved with the Process of Global Compact on Migration that was adopted in December 2018, providing a voluntary governance framework for managing migration.\nAn important contribution that Sri Lanka has been making for over five decades is our modest role in UN Peacekeeping efforts. Key among these developments is the deployment to Mali, where some of our troops have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of global peace and security.\nSri Lanka was also successful in its bid for election to the Intergovernmental Committee on Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of UNESCO for the term 2018 -2022. Sri Lanka obtained 122 votes in support of its candidature.\nAs part of its Buddhist Diplomacy, under the leadership of President Sirisena Sri Lanka is initiating an important diplomatic endeavour towards the Theravada Tripitakaya being recognized as world heritage through registration in the UNESCO Memory of the World Index , with the assistance of all the Buddhist countries in the world. This diplomatic effort commenced with a dignified ceremony at the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy on 23 March 2019, when President Maithripala Sirisena handed over the proposal seeking to declare the Theravada Tripitaka, the sacred scripture of Buddhists, as a UNESCO World Heritage to the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka, Hanaa Singer. This historic moment followed a week of commemorative events nationally and throughout the network of Sri Lanka Missions overseas, through which international awareness was created of this historic initiative.\n\nIn the sphere of Climate Change, Sri Lanka remains committed towards achieving the goals set by the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. During the recently concluded Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) in London, Sri Lanka pledged to champion the Action Group for the Restoration of Mangroves under the Commonwealth Blue Charter. The 18thmeeting of the State Parties to the CITES will be hosted by Sri Lanka this year. In this regard, the Ministry continues to liaise with related local stakeholders and the CITES Secretariat on the extensive preparations for the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Bilateral Relations\n\n\n\n\n Economic Affairs\n\n\nThe Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry launched the Economic Diplomacy Programme (EDP) in mid-2018 by serving as a catalyst in promoting linkages between key government institutions and the private sector responsible for trade, investment, tourism and foreign employment, and Sri Lanka missions abroad. As documented in the publication before you, this programme includes; setting economic indicators and performance targets for missions in the economic promotion in selected markets; the Sri Lanka Foreign Relations and Economic Diplomacy Dialogue for mid-career diplomats from selected countries; and embarking on a number of pilot projects spanning a multitude of sectors. We also envision public diplomacy being a tool used for better engagement with Overseas Sri Lankans and a valuable asset in times of emergencies.\n\n\n Public Diplomacy \n\n\nThe Ministry has also taken several initiatives to enhance its public outreach. As an initial step, the Public Diplomacy Division of the Ministry is being revamped and strengthened with additional resources and staff to be responsive to the current developments. With a view to enhancing the skills of its personnel, especially of nineteen recently recruited officers to the Sri Lanka Foreign Service, a two-week Public Diplomacy training programme was organized in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Press Institute in December 2018/ January 2019. The Ministry is in the process of developing a comprehensive Public Diplomacy policy in the form of a manual that could be used by the Ministry and Sri Lanka Missions overseas, particularly in effective public communications and use of recent social media tools.\n\n\n\n Policy Planning & Research\n\n\nThe Policy Planning and Research Division of the Foreign Ministry also works in close cooperation with the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI) and the Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute (BIDTI).\n\n\n Human Rights\n\n\n\n\nIn my address to the Human Rights Council and subsequently in a meeting we had with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, I raised our concerns with regard to certain erroneous information contained in her report with regard to the Mannar mass graves and the release of lands held by the military in the North and the East. I urged her of the importance of engaging closely with the relevant local institutions and independent bodies including the National Human Rights Commission in verifying facts on the ground.\n\n\n\nHon Speaker,\n\n\n\n\nThank you.\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "b1edee5f7626375888bc02b32f530536"}

And how best we could move forward together advancing collective measures, even as the pandemic persists and is bound to cast a long shadow into the future.\nThe relevance of the theme, however, lies in the evolving contours of a global order that is in the making. There is no doubt that the ground under our feet is shifting though slowly unpredictably in terms of a new orientation.\nAs I address you today, it is the reality that we are entering a global new norm brought about by the ongoing Covid19 pandemic. Lives, livelihoods, and health of the people around the world have faced with the greatest challenge in one hundred years.\n\nForeign Policy of Sri Lanka is pursuing a fresh vision based upon the \"Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour\" the manifesto of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, which received overwhelming mandates from the People of Sri Lanka in November 2019 & August 2020. In accordance the Ministry has adopted \"20 Point Key Foreign Policy Directives for 2020 and beyond\".\nAs the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka I had occasions since coming to office, to elaborate and supplement the central thrust of these policy statements. Our highest priority is to maintain friendly relations with all sovereign countries as an equal partner, whilst upholding a policy of neutrality and Non-alignment without being involved in the superpower rivalry.\n\nWith these comes responsibilities to our People, to the region and the world at large. Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity is a founding pillar of our engagement. We see the importance of maintaining freedom in navigation in our seas and air space and protecting sea lines of communication and undersea cables.\n\nDistinguished Friends,\nWe work together with other nations towards the development of the country and the people whilst protecting our sovereignty and territorial integrity. Similarly, we respect sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference on internal affairs of other countries. Mutual respect as well as friendship with all, is the core of our principles of engagement.\nSri Lanka gives utmost priority to the close cooperation between South-Asian countries and similarly with other Asian countries to ensure regional and strategic security.\nSri Lanka is a founder and committed member of Non-Aligned Movement, and the most important pillar of our foreign policy is neutrality and non-alignment.\nThis month we celebrated 90th year of Universal Suffrage, as one of the foremost Parliamentary Democracies in Asia. Therefore, it is the Will of the People that prevails in making our national policies and decisions. It is this Will which formulates what is best to cooperate in specific areas of national advancement. Where Sri Lanka looks forward to further on closer cooperation with Nepal too.\nPresident Gotabaya Rajapaksa's Government has embarked on a new chapter of socio-economic development. Both Singapore and Dubai had been key Financial centers, whilst there had been a long overdue in between. This will be served by the Colombo International Financial Center based at Colombo Port City.\nAs Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka I wish to make this the opportunity to request and invite Foreign Investors to come and invest, where we will extend our fullest facilitation. Surely, this will create much greater access not only for Nepal but also to all connected entrepreneurs and investors.\nSri Lanka will continue to explore new investment, trade and employment ventures and opportunities. Our entrepreneurs and professionals have the capacity and skills to contribute to the economic progress of other countries, while bringing benefits for Sri Lanka.\nDistinguished Friends,\nI must take this opportunity to state categorically that Sri Lanka has always opted for, and has consistently been pursuing, international cooperation and multilateralism for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe engage in constructive dialogue with foreign countries in order to obtain their support for furthering Sri Lanka's interest in the international arena on the environment, sustainable agriculture, and food security, development of human resources, and economic prosperity. We need to work for regional economic integration and enhanced maritime connectivity and trade and culture.\nWe have the passion and commitment to advance the Blue Economy with the sustainable and responsible use of ocean resources and innovative technologies as important priorities. A proactive climate positive foreign policy is in our national interest, as an island nation prone to climate change and adverse effects.\nWhile Sri Lanka appreciates the role of Nepal as a land-lock in the Himalayas against climate change, we wish to collectively further cooperate with strong commitment towards climate friendly manners and for more clean Oxygen. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has embarked on the journey to achieve 70% of renewable energy generation by 2030.\nI trust everyone connected with Nepal Conclave will support our call for international consideration for a debt moratorium, to emerge out of the economic crisis prevailing in most countries owing to the current global pandemic.\nBefore concluding, it is earnest to mention that Youth, those below 35 years of age consists two-thirds of 1.9 Billion people living in South Asia, and naturally half of them are women. No doubt they will have to manage much better on growing demands of Water, Food, and Land. Therefore, I wish to invite even more socio-economic programs and actions targeting the Youth and Women at all counts. Importantly as of Education - Employment - Environment.\nDistinguished Friends,\nWe are facing unprecedented times that are stressful for us all - a time that challenges our relationships and we have witnessed globally, situations of anger and hostility. We must reject hate and ensure that there is no room for it in our responses.\n\n\n............................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.....................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "b26953e21f8a3f8daa51ec67040ce538"}

Serious note was taken by the envoys regarding the use of children in terrorist propaganda activities, leading to the radicalization of new generations of youth and children.\nThe High Commissioners conveyed the strong position of their governments that there was no tolerance for terrorist activities nor glorification of terrorism, in their countries, and the recent spate of acts of non-state entities in no way reflected a change in their official position on such matters.\nMinister Gunawardena thanked the envoys for the continued commitment in the global fight against terrorism, including the commitment to ensure non-resurgence of the LTTE, which remains proscribed as a terrorist group in both the United Kingdom and Canada.\nHe noted that being Commonwealth countries, the relations between Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom and Canada are deep-rooted, steadfast and wide-ranging, and expressed confidence of continued close cooperation.

Though a low emission country, it has been compelled to bear the brunt of extreme and persistent adverse weather conditions of longer droughts and frequent floods generated by rising temperatures and sea levels. This has caused significant loss of life and serious damage to property and infrastructure, slowing down economic growth and impeding progress.\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\nMr. President,\nWe are aware that quality education remains the key to social progress and economic empowerment. It is a fundamental right and is crucial to our efforts in reducing unemployment, poverty and exclusion. Despite continued efforts globally, progress on ensuring the provision and access to quality education remains far from satisfactory. Rapid technological advancements, while providing opportunities for some, are likely to exacerbate the widening of the global digital gap. There is an urgent need to sharpen our efforts to provide quality education, particularly for women, girls and other vulnerable sections of society.\n\nMr. President,\n\nChallenge to Multilateralism\nMr. President,\nAs we persevere in these efforts to reverse the negative trends, our ability in addressing global challenges have been compromised in recent times by the increasing threat to multilateralism. There is an imperative need to examine the basis for this phenomenon within a rules-based international order, so as to arrest this deterioration. Sri Lanka urges for greater efforts within the UN to revitalize multilateralism, driven by equality in order to make the world body more cohesive, relevant and responsive to the needs of all Member States.\nAs the UN approaches its 75th anniversary next year, this is an excellent opportunity to assess its successes and failures including its engagement with Member States. Partnerships fostered between Member States and the UN, over seven decades based on trust and equity must not be compromised and allowed to be hijacked by actors accountable to none and with selective political agendas.

Failure to do so will not only vilify this august body and negate the values that it represents, but will also break the trust of Member States, jeopardizing the partnership with the UN.\nDisarmament\nMr. President,\n\nAdditionally, in the recent years, Sri Lanka acceded to a number of disarmament treaties, including the Ottawa Convention. Sri Lanka has also presided over the States Parties Meetings on the Conventions on Certain Conventional Weapons and also that on Cluster Munitions.\nThe 2020 NPT Review Conference will also provide an opportunity for Member States to deliver on its commitments, as the Treaty marks the 50th anniversary of entry into force next year. Sri Lanka reiterates its commitment to a successful Review Conference, focusing on progress in the three pillars of the Treaty.\n\nPeacekeeping\nMr. President,\n\nAs a Troop Contributing Country, Sri Lanka was pleased to endorse the Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) Declaration of shared commitments last year and is confident that it would revitalize the collective efforts in making such operations effective and coherent.\n\n\nPalestine\nMr. President,\nSri Lanka is concerned about the deteriorating situation in the Occupied Palestine territory including East Jerusalem, where the continuing expansion of settlements across the occupied West Bank is causing increased demolition of homes.\n\n\nDevelopment & Peace\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nThis incident also reminded us that no country is immune to the bane of radicalization, extremism and terrorism.

{"title": "Valedictory address by Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha, Secretary, Ministry of  Foreign Affairs at  Colombo Defence Seminar on 30 August 2019", "date": "date", "content": "\nLet me at the outset, extend my warm congratulation to the Sri Lanka Army which has conceptualized and organized this annual Colombo Defence Seminar for the 9th consecutive year. This Seminar has become an internationally recognized forum for intellectual exchange and discussion on issues of contemporary relevance, particularly related to strategic issues and security - nationally, regionally and internationally.\nI am honored to have been invited to deliver the valedictory address this year, to this gathering which comprises eminent practitioners and scholars from 40 friendly countries, as well as prominent defense policy planners, practitioners and analysts within Sri Lanka. As I am addressing this gathering at a time when there was change of Command in the Sri Lanka Army, I wish to acknowledge the former Commander Gen Mahesh Senanayake who invited me to deliver this address, while also wishing thenew Commander Lt. General. Shavendra Silva, a very successful tenure.\n\n\nIn the context of this Seminar, I intend to fulfill the meaning of the valedictory speech in giving some insight from my vantage point, which I hope would add to the rich food for thought gleaned during this seminar, as we go our ways to make better informed decisions.\n\n\nAs I do so, I am deeply conscious that while this is essentially a case study of contemporary Sri Lanka, there are lessons from it that could be drawn by all countries, vulnerable to the threats posed by contemporary terrorism.\nContext\n\n\nIn response to this complex, growing threat of terrorism, the international community, over the years has developed a common universal legal framework, which comprises 19 international legal instruments strengthened by relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions. This framework confers a general obligation on Sates to ensure right to life and security of their citizens and recognizes the necessity and sufficient conditions to activate the threshold of emergency in the fight against terrorism, subject to the requirements of legality, proportionality and non-discrimination.\nEqually relevant in this context is the UN framework on Countering Violent Extremism reinforced by the Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism presented by the UN Secretary General in January 2016 where States are called to adopt a comprehensive approach encompassing not only security-based counter-terrorism measures but also preventive measures to address the conditions that drive individuals to radicalize and join extremist groups. This Plan of Action also calls out for a holistic approach grounded in human rights in the efforts to prevent VE.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures Post Easter Sunday attacks \n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity response and Community engagement\n\nIn the aftermath of 21/4, we witnessed the re-confirmation of the strength of law enforcement and security apparatus of Sri Lanka to secure the country and prevent any further attacks. We have done so, while allowing for the mourning and coming to terms with our loss, and embarking on the rebuilding and recovery process necessary\n\nThis security response would not have been possible without the assistance of the Sri Lankan community at large. The resilience of the social trust within Sri Lanka, despite the attempts of terrorists to destroy the social fabric of the country, was evident in the aftermath of the attacks. It speaks to the enduring link built in the past, between our communities and law enforcement authorities, that communities themselves were coming forward to warn of dangers to society. This is not to be lightly overlooked or taken for granted. It must be maintained and nourished with continued, good faith engagement.\nThe swift imposition of the State of Emergency, the temporary suspensions of social media to arrest escalation of the situation and mitigate the ability of mischief makers to destabilize society at a vulnerable junction and the re-operationalization of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) - which had been held in abeyance for a while, were the main tools deployed by the Sri Lankan State in the course of swiftly restoring normalcy in the immediate aftermath of 21/4.\n\nAll these acts bear testimony to the practical relevance of the need to balance - security and freedoms, where the tools at the disposal of governments and law enforcement authorities to ensure security, as exercised by all governments the world over, is tempered with our sense of protecting the rights of the citizenry who must be allowed to benefit from a secured country.\n\nArrests and Detention\n\nIn the immediate aftermath and ongoing efforts to restore a sense of security of citizens at large, persons suspected or revealed to have connections with the Easter Sunday attackers were detained/arrested. Full access to these individuals in detention by the ICRC was guaranteed and any complaints regards detentions or any reports of mistreatment were immediately directed to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission, who have already launched investigations and issued guidelines.\nIn this manner, the effective neutralizing of the terrorist threats by prompt action by the intelligence and law enforcement authorities, has been also balanced by independent Human Rights mechanisms. This speaks of a robust, healthy system that works in tandem to check and balances each other for the betterment of society.\n\nLegislative responses that conform to the international standards\n\n\n\nAmendments have also been made to Regulations relating to UNSCR 1267 and 1373 to expand the regulations to include provisions to request foreign states to designate individuals, entities and groups suspected of being involved in terrorist activities and widen the coverage of freezing orders.\n\nAs previously noted, the relevant authorities are also coordinating on reviewing the counter terrorism legislation in view of the Easter Sunday attacks through the prism of the new aspects of terrorism revealed by these attacks, including the abuse of social media.\n\ninformation dissemination and economic growth, including supporting entrepreneurship in startups, the SME sector and online economic endeavours.\n\nAdministrative responses\n\n\n\nAddressing the lacuna of knowledge and international collaborations \n\n\nIn his inaugural address yesterday, Secretary Defense Gen. ShanthaKottegoda called for a global joint strategy to combat terrorism and violent extremism, insisting that developing countries need special assistance and support to upgrade their capabilities to combat radicalization and extremist organizations.\n\nAdditionally, and even more crucially of course, many of you in uniform are aware of the considerable extent of cooperation that has been both ongoing and stepped up since 21/4 between Sri Lankan intelligence, criminal investigative and criminal justice agencies, with their respective counterparts from friendly countries and global and regional police organizations across the world.\nGOSL has also participated in international conference/seminars/workshops and trainings on CT and related subjects in the past several months in order to learn from best practices in law enforcement, community engagement, PVE and CVE, relevant legislation, policy, from countries that have been facing this new phase of terrorism over the past decade. Close coordination among relevant divisions of the Foreign Ministry and other relevant Ministries and agencies has enabled to avoid duplication of these efforts.\n\nAs we move forward the need for shared understandings on these issues, intelligence cooperation and adopting the best practices related to each of these issues from other countries in a Sri Lankan context specific manner, must be emphasized.\n\n\nOngoing projects/processes being put in place\n\nArmed with knowledge and capacity building measures, which may be renewed periodically, officials from the several spheres have been deployed to create and implement, with national and international support, context specific response efforts for Sri Lanka geared towards achieving tangible outcomes.\nSome of these initiatives being formulated and would soon come into fruition includes:\n\nSecuring borders\n\n\n\nInternet and Social media\n\n\n\n\n\nDe-radicalization and PVE measures\n\n\nIn this context, it is necessary to develop the critical thinking capacity of youth, strengthen community bonds, sense of civic duty, and build community resilience to mitigate the effects and influences of violent extremist ideology leading to terrorism that may escape the ever-watchful eye of law enforcement authorities. The role of the community and their resilience against the local drivers of extremism are essential in preventing violent extremism.\n\nHowever, radicalization due to religious ideology is a new, complex and extremely sensitive phenomenon, and requires a whole of society approach.\nIn this context, the Foreign Ministry has taken the initiative to seek assistance to support the GOSL national plans and goals of preventing violent extremism. The current visit of Dr. Khalid Koser, Executive Director of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF) who is also joining us here today, is in this context both timely and significant as we can draw from his expertise and experience in working in several countries, as we chart our way forward in drawing up measures on how to address this issue. Efforts in this regard must be extremely sensitive to the context specificity of issues and therefore its solutions. It is imperative to avoid broad brush strokes in identifying the needs of communities in different countries, with their own unique histories and context.\n\nSetbacks to the economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, as stated at a news conference held yesterday by Finance Minister MangalaSamarawera and State Minister of Finance EranWickramaratne, the economic recovery has exceeded expectations, when compared with countries that were placed in similar circumstances and took considerably more time to re-bounce. It is good to know that notwithstanding all we have been through, according to the Ministers, Sri Lanka will grow by about 3.2% in 2019.\n\n\nWay forward for Sri Lanka\n\n\n\nThis is a truism that will apply to Sri Lanka, as it probably will to most of the countries you represent and beyond.\nI thank you.\n------------------\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "bcc05d99bcc33835b461dc3422f4d93e"}

{"title": "47th Consultative Committee Meeting of The Colombo Plan Inaugural address by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nMr. President, Hon. Ministers, Chair of the 46th CCM, Heads of Delegations, Secretary General of The Colombo Plan, Heads and Representatives of International Organizations, Foreign Secretary Admiral Colombage, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends.\nIt is a pleasure to be here amongst all of you, albeit virtually, and I thank you for taking the time to be with us notwithstanding the immense challenges of these times. This is a clear demonstration of your commitment to advance the cause of The Colombo Plan. Given that the global climate calls for even more focus on economic and social development, our meeting today and tomorrow is timely. Home to about 40% of the global population with a combined GDP of approximately US$ 37 trillion, I believe this is where our collective strength lies and from where we can and should derive our inspiration and drive.\nThe Colombo Plan was conceived at the Commonwealth Conference on Foreign Affairs held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 1950, launched by seven founding members (Australia, Britain, Canada, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), India, New Zealand and Pakistan) on 1st July 1951, chaired by the Late Hon. D.S. Senanayake, Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), now includes 27 members.\n\n\n\nThe success of the cause of our organization depends on the commitment, contribution and meaningful action of all member states. But contextual challenges and individual realities in the countries can inhibit their contribution at full capacity. This has posed a challenge to the organization in sourcing funds and other resources for its initiatives and programs. Sri Lanka is concerned that this constraint in turn has hampered the organization from serving its membership at the ideal potential. We would like to request advanced member states to continue extending their valuable support to The Colombo Plan so that it may sustain and further develop meaningful programs for the developing member states, ensuring shared prosperity for all.\nA fully functioning secretariat is also of utmost importance as we navigate these challenging times. Mutual cooperation between the secretariat and the member states is key. The pandemic has affected us all, barring none. Sri Lanka is pleased to have been able to implement a strong vaccination drive with the help of our international friends and partners. We are happy that many of you chose to stay back to see your duties through.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to touch on a topic - Sustainable Green Cities: Increasing Green Spaces - that will be discussed at length when we present our country theme paper later in the morning.\n\n\nThis issue and its connection to global development efforts, engendered the stand-alone goal in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, SDG 11: Make inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities.\nUrban areas contribute to about 70 per cent of the global GDP making these areas driving forces of the economy. They also account for about 70 percent of global carbon emissions, thereby worsening air pollution, and 60 percent of resource use, as increasing urban populations overstrain infrastructure and exert pressure on public services and limited resources. Rapid and unplanned urbanization also results in the deterioration of the environment and shrinks green spaces.\nThe adverse effects on the environment, health and wellbeing of populations demand immediate action and call for innovative approaches to promote access to nature, to reduce pollution and mitigate extreme weather patterns and promote sustainable lifestyles. The pandemic has increased the gravity of the situation in densely populated urban areas, and has driven home the importance of access to nature and open spaces.\nWhile grappling with rapid urbanization is a global requirement, the severity of its effects have a greater impact on developing countries and poorer nations who are constantly playing technological catchup. Building sustainable cities calls for investment. Therefore, these countries need support and resources to improve capacity building, to access green technology, energy and infrastructure, to design and develop sustainable and reliable public services such as housing, electricity, water, waste recycling and public transportation, to name a few.\nProf Ranil Senanayake a leading global environmentalist of Sri Lanka proposes a paradigm shift in the green environment climate discussion. His insights are that urban sector is the real spoiler of the air we breathe. Oxygen is burnt every single time an engine ignites in a car, bus, train, plane, factory or generator. The only reintroduction of Oxygen is done by our rural green areas. Thus our focus should also be on Oxygen.\nWhen the time the UN is ringing warning alarms on climate, it is important that we recognize countries that have shown positive ecological contribution and commitment. A recognition in form of a positive return to offset financial debt or difficulty. Thanks to their contribution and commitment, we the world are still breathing.\nIn this respect it is important to keep in mind the trends of dynamics of the Generation Changes amongst the youth where through fast tracked technological innovations - methodologies are being renewed and replaced within shortened time lines.\nWe remain committed to assisting the organization to grow while it endeavors to cope with the challenges of our time and pursues social and economic prosperity for our region.\nI wish you all two fruitful days of discussion and deliberation.\nThank you!\n....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n......................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "be30fdc1fb193f8e9602a7784b1935e9"}

He appreciated the support extended by the countries in favour of Sri Lanka.\nVideo Link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N1IfiA9u8Dg\n..............................................\nForeign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said that it is a victory for Sri Lanka that only 22 of the 47 member states of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) have voted in favour of the resolution against Sri Lanka. The vote on the resolution against Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council in Geneva took place on 23 March 2021.\nThe Foreign Minister addressed a media briefing at the Foreign Ministry after the voting. The Minister pointed out that, only the countries of dominant ideology had voted in favour of the resolution. He also pointed out that it is against the Charter of the United Nations to isolate selected countries of the member states of the Human Rights Commission and file charges against them. The people have voted to elect Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the President of the country with an overwhelming majority and then the majority has voted to form a strong government for him. The previous government had co-sponsored and passed these resolutions at the Geneva Human Rights Conference to put our country in a dangerous situation. After the election of our Government in 2019, we participated in the 43rd Human Rights Council and withdrew from that co-sponsorship. There, we said that we would abide by the constitution of our country. We have been working accordingly ever since. Today the whole world is plagued by the COVID pandemic. More than a hundred countries are distressed by the inability to get the vaccine. At such a time, the primary responsibility of the Human Rights Council should be to rescue the people affected by the COVID pandemic and keep them alive. We have stated this at the conference. We completely rejected the report of the Commissioner for Human Rights against us, pointing out that the report contained baseless statistics and misinformation. We also call on the member states of the Human Rights Council to oppose the resolution. The Human Rights Council cannot act contrary to the UN Charter. They cannot act contrary to the original proposal for establishing the Human Rights Council. According to the UN Charter, they cannot select individual countries as they wish and make accusations against them. Only 22 out of the 47 member states of the UNHRC have voted in favour of the resolution against our country which was brought in contrary to that basic policy, by the countries including Britain, Germany, Canada and several other countries. As a result, they have lost the majority. It has defeated the attempt to control the South or the hard-won independence of the colonial countries, by the North. Especially the President, the Prime Minister, our government and those important ones who love the country got together and made the world aware of this. None of us got to attend this conference due to the COVID pandemic. We are committed to defending the sovereignty and freedom of our country and defeating the resolution against us, despite of their holding virtual conferences and influencing countries like our's. As we promised then, a Presidential Commission headed by a Supreme Court Judge has been appointed to investigate human rights violations and its work is continuing. We are working to make the 2030 Sustainable Development Plan declared by the United Nations a success. We have also created an environment where any Sinhalese, Tamil or Muslim living in our country can travel, live and settle anywhere from Point Pedro to Dondra Head. Today, the country has been transformed into a country that protects the civil rights destroyed by the LTTE terrorists. The resolution against us by several countries including Britain excluding these positive points could not get a majority but only 22 votes. Also, 11 votes have been cast against the resolution. 14 countries have abstained from voting for the British resolutions. Accordingly, 25 out of 47 countries have not agreed with this resolution. That is very important, said Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.\n\n\n..............................................\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "c060a5969a063e2d80e19efcdd6498ee"}

In this context both sides agreed that a Joint Action Plan be drafted at the next Thailand - Sri Lanka Sub-Committee on Trade Related Matters Meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka.\nThe Prime Minister of Thailand informed the President of Sri Lanka about the keen interest among Thai companies to invest in Sri Lanka. The President of Sri Lanka welcomed their interest, and the two leaders discussed ways and means to further encourage and facilitate more investments from Thailand to Sri Lanka.\nOn the area of technical cooperation, both sides witnessed the signing of the \"Joint Action Programme for Cooperation on Sustainable Community Development Model based on the Application of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\". The said Joint Action Programme is intended to expand the application of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy of His Majesty the Late King Bhumibol Adulyadej in Sri Lanka. This joint cooperation will significantly assist Sri Lanka to further augment the social and economic conditions conducive for rural communities.\nThe President of Sri Lanka expressed his appreciation for the technical assistance extended by the Royal Thai Government in rainmaking technology to address issues of hydro-power generation and facilitate irrigation for agricultural purposes. The President of Sri Lanka also noted with satisfaction the existing collaboration between the experts in agriculture of the two countries, and in this context thanked the Thai Prime Minister for the expertise shared to identify possible means of modernizing the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, with a view to enhancing the collaboration in agricultural and fisheries sectors, the two leaders, while recognizing the importance of convening the related Joint Working Groups, expressed that the two sides prioritise the exchange of proposals on envisaged cooperation.\nIn addition, the two leaders also witnessed the signing of the Treaty between the Kingdom of Thailand and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on the Transfer of Offenders and on Co-operation in the Enforcement of Penal Sentences and the Memorandum of Understanding between Kasetsart University and the Ministry of Primary Industries on Technological Collaboration Related to Value Addition of Primary Products. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce was also concluded.\nFollowing the meeting, the President of Sri Lanka hosted a banquet in honour of the Prime Minister of Thailand and his delegation at the President's House. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe hosted a breakfast meeting for the Thai Prime Minister and his delegation on the following day.\nThe Prime Minister of Thailand visited the historic city of Kandy and paid homage to the sacred Tooth Relic. He also called on the Most Venerable Mahanayake Theros of the Malwatta and Asgiriya Chapters of the Siam Sect. The Prime Minister of Thailand also visited the Royal Botanic Garden, Peradeniya, and planted a sapling to mark his visit to Sri Lanka.\nThis successful high-level visit reflects the timeless partnership between Thailand, Sri Lanka and their peoples, which is based on shared historic, religious and cultural affinities, augmented by mutually beneficial economic ties.\n\n13 July 2018\n\n\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "c49ecc6b431e36e59208b3c04738edc3"}

Foreign Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka at the Launch of the UN Network on Migration in Sri Lanka, 11 November 2020", "date": "date", "content": "\n\nAyubowan,\nMr. Chairman,\nExcellencies, Distinguished Guests\nI am deeply honoured to deliver the opening address at the Launch of the Sri Lanka Chapter of the United Nations Global Network on Migration. At the outset may I take the opportunity to extend a warm appreciation to Her Excellency Madam Hanaa Singer, the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka and Mr. Sarat Dash, Chief of the International Organization for Migration for inviting me to deliver the opening address at this event.\n\n\nThe 270 million international migrants amount to around 3.5% of the global population. 60% of this constitutes labour migrants. There is indeed overwhelming evidence to demonstrate the significant socio-economic contributions of these labour migrants to both the countries of destination (COD) and to the countries of origin (COO).\nSri Lanka has seen a tenfold increase in migrant numbers in the last two decades, and current estimates suggest that around 1.5 million migrants work overseas, with an annual outflow of about 200,000 persons. Around 800,000 of these overseas Sri Lankans work in the Middle Eastern region.\nSri Lanka has over the years developed a good overseas employment administration system, starting with the establishment of the Bureau of Foreign Employment in 1985. Despite administrative and legal regulations, laws and services, Sri Lanka continues to face a number of challenges in the field of foreign employment. The concentration of labour migration in low skilled categories dominated by female workers with associated issues of protection, low remuneration, and the narrow range of destinations with high dependence remains a major challenge for the Government of Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\n\nI wish to express our deepest appreciation to all countries that have already taken positive steps to provide temporary relief measures to the Sri Lankan migrants during these challenging times.\nIn the current global setting our labour migrants are facing additional challenges which include loss of employment and reduction of earnings. Furthermore, we have witnessed a decline in the outbound travel of labour migrants by 57.2% in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019. This stands out in comparison to around 200,000 Sri Lankans who previously sought foreign employment annually.\nSince COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, we are facing hitherto unknown and unprecedented challenges. The COVID 19 crisis has brought about a devastating impact on economies and societies. 10 years short of the ambitious 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, the impact of the COVID Pandemic has caused a serious impediment to realizing the benefits of the many important measures taken to alleviate poverty, and other sustainable development goals.\nWith the launch of the Migration Network in Sri Lanka, we can collectively explore and develop practical solutions to best assist and protect our migrant workers during these challenging times. It is also important that the voices of our migrants are heard and included at all stages of the initiatives.\nThe Government of Sri Lanka looks forward to engaging closely with the UN Network on Migration and our long-standing trusted partner, the international Organization for Migration, drawing on the knowledge and expertise that best benefits the people of Sri Lanka.\nThank you\nThe full video is at:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XAMCd4yQcYo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full video is at:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XAMCd4yQcYo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full video is at:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XAMCd4yQcYo\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "c76fad696d95355d9d788882807318d0"}

Especially, the war heroes had to face numerous bitter experiences and difficulties when battling one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world which did not respect law.\nDuring those 30 years, helpless civilians got killed everywhere in the country. A large number of lives and properties were lost due to suicide attacks, bombing in buses, trains and buildings carried out by the terrorists.\nThe prime objective of the Humanitarian Mission was to bring lasting peace in the country.\nBecause of the exceptional sacrifices made by our war heroes, today we have the opportunity to live in peace and harmony in a unitary state.\nOur country, nourished by Buddhist philosophy, possesses a form of administration that an oasis for all religions and all nationalities.\nThroughout its history, people in this country including Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay and Burgher have had equal rights.\nThe motive of the extremists was to divide us. If they were successful in their attempt, our history could have taken a different course. Sri Lanka could have become a country where communities hate each other, engage in continuous battles for borders, fear of war is a common norm of life and another hapless and divided country.\nThe honor of liberating the country from this catastrophe should be given to all our heroic troops who fought for the peace in our country for a long time.\nWe remember with immense gratitude, all the war heroes including General Kobbekaduwa and General Vijaya Wimalarathna who fought for this victory for more than 3 decades and laid their lives for the country.\nAs an officer who was engaged in active service for around 20 years, later as the Secretary Defence for 10 years as well as a citizen I am very well aware of the sacrifices made by our war heroes.\nPain of the war is not strange to me.\nTherefore, I will not allow any room for attempts to discredit and destroy the dignity of our war heroes who made countless sacrifices to bring peace to entire Sri Lanka.\nI assure you that under my administration, we will take every measure always to protect the dignity of our heroic forces.\nIt is a national responsibility to ensure their rights.\nIn a situation where even leaders of powerful countries have emphatically stated that they would not allow any action against their war heroes, in a small country like ours where our war heroes have sacrificed so much, I will not allow anyone to exert undue pressure on them or harass them.\nIf any international body or organization continuously target our country and our war heroes, using baseless allegations, I will also not hesitate to withdraw Sri Lanka from such bodies or organizations.\nWe pay the tribute of the nation to all war heroes and their families who contributed to the battle against separatism for 3 decades.\nThe highest honour that can be bestowed on them is to transform this country which was protected by them by laying their lives to a land where every citizenry can live in peace, harmony and with dignity.\nAt this War Memorial, I invite all patriotic citizens to make your fullest contribution towards this endeavor.\nI thank you all.\nMay the noble Triple Gem bless you.\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "c8d69ec33bd034ed83ec24085d4b6407"}

Sri Lanka produced the first female Prime Minister in the world in 1960.Sri Lankan women have continued to hold several high-ranking positions in the country as Members of Parliament and local Government, Secretaries to Ministries, Heads of Diplomatic Missions, and the Judiciary. Women represent half of the working population in the country and excel in higher education. Their contribution to the national economy is very significant. Women represent 34.5% of the labour force while 39% of expatriate work force consists of women.\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nIn line with the above policy framework, the Government will facilitate and ensure the contribution of Sri Lankan women to the betterment of our society as an equal player, in an environment where women will make their own decisions and will be free to reach their aspirations and will not be subject to any violence or discrimination.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n", "id": "cb69925c3b573983b81f5bf638c3549e"}

Peiris at the Ministerial Sessions on \u2018Foreign Policy and Religion\u2019 at the G20 Interfaith Forum, Bologna, Italy", "date": "date", "content": "\n\n\n\n\nThey are two sides of the same coin. But I think we need to ask ourselves, Mr. Chairman, in a spirit of frankness of candor, whether the United Nations system is functioning today in the manner that was envisaged by the founding fathers. If you look at the seminal documents of the United Nations system- the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration of Human Rights- are we really behaving in the manner that was envisioned by these sacrosanct instruments? I don't think one could sincerely answer that question in the affirmative.\nToday, reference was made to COVID-19 and the responses to that. Look at the Bretton Woods institutions. The Bretton Woods institutions were also fashioned in a certain political context that is the end of the Second World War but the world has changed a great deal since then. But those institutions remain largely as they were. Now the developing world in particular, if the World Bank, for example, were to agree to a policy of debt forgiveness in the excruciatingly difficult circumstances that we have today, then countries that are developing would be able to use their own scarce resources for projects connected with the welfare of their populations. Now take my own country Sri Lanka. We normally earn 4.2 billion dollars a year from tourism. That has come almost to a complete stop. Then our trade relations have been affected. Money coming into the Sri Lankan Treasury from the efforts of our expatriates working abroad in countries like Italy has been affected. So in that situation, if the World Bank were to agree to a policy of debt forgiveness, I think that would greatly accelerate and facilitate the economic development of our countries.\nThen look at the composition of the Security Council. Does that in any way reflect the reality of the modern world? It does not. It reflects a certain balance of powers that was only realistic at the conclusion of the Second World War. But today there are other emerging powers. I won't name countries but the entire organization needs to be basically overhauled to bring it in line with contemporary realities. The Economic and Social Council needs to be strengthened. Again, there has to be an emphasis on equality, on human dignity. The whole world, not a section of the world. It is not one section - affluent, powerful, dominating the rest of the world and using the United Nations system as an instrument for their domination. That is what creates a certain lack of confidence in the organs and the structures associated with the United Nations system.

The visit was coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Office of the Speaker in close association with the High Commission of Sri Lanka in Canada and Consulate General of Toronto.\nThe 18-member delegation consists of two Members of Parliament of Canada, Han Dong and Rachel Thomas, and they called on President of Sri Lanka, Prime Minister, Speaker of The House, Minister of Foreign Affairs and other political leadership in order to be briefed on the economic and political dimensions of the country. On the same note, the delegation interacted with corporate and industry leaders of Sri Lanka and attended meetings organized by the Business Chambers, Export Development Board, Board of Investment and other relevant economic and investment institutions.\nDuring the meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 3rd November 2022, chaired by the Minister Ali Sabry and State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, along with Foreign Secretary Ambassador Aruni Wijewardane, the delegation stated that the primary objective of the visit was to connect with the people as well as the wellbeing of the people of Sri Lanka, since they have been out of the country for many decades. As such, they have given much consideration to engage in commercial and investment activity with the aim of uplifting the socio-economic landscape of the country. Their desire to give back to the country stems from having received facilities and capabilities such as education and healthcare afforded to them without any cost.\nMost of the members of the delegation own large business enterprises and are founders of companies, mostly based in Canada. They are eager to enter into joint ventures, commercial enterprises and other economic activity as well as charitable endeavors in the country. Many of the delegates stated that they were keen to re-establish their roots in the country, mostly in Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. They envisaged that a visit by overseas Sri Lankan nationals to Sri Lanka would transmit a compelling message to other countries where a large number of overseas Sri Lankans reside. The business delegates were also keen to revitalize the SME sector of Sri Lanka.\nThe high-level business delegation would be able to connect with and persuade leading corporate captains and the leisure industry in Canada to consider Sri Lanka as their next investment or touristic destination. The business delegates expressed their wish to assist Sri Lanka in overcoming the current economic situation.\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nColombo\n4 November, 2022\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "cf77e957782f3e198e33375af415edae"}

Mohan Peiris,\nPermanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations\nThursday, 18 February 2021\nVirtual meeting\nMr. President,\nThroughout history racism, xenophobia and discrimination have indeed tested our democratic values and the contemporary forms of discrimination presents to us major challenges in our quest for peace and social stability. The unabated tirade of hate speech, a resurgence of nationalist populism and organizations that promote ideologies of racial superiority are debacles for all of us. How do we move beyond the rhetoric and move forward to address these issues? This brings to mind the late President Nelson Mandela when he said and I quote:\n\n\n\nSadly, as we in Sri Lanka strive to make the most of the decade of action with the SDGs at the center of the development policies for all the people of the country, we continue to face the impediments associated with the hatred propagated by various parties. What is even sadder is the complete distortion of facts by people in authority and segments of our own global community and international institutions that continue to add fuel to the fire of hatred that is surely losing its heat. Sri Lanka is being penalized for looking after the best interests of its own people and for making progress in moving forward. No doubt, such foreign actions will only serve to stall the progress that has already been made.\n\nDear friends,\nIt would appear that supremacist behavior will remain to be a fact of life that we will have to live with whilst pursuing our noble path to reimaging equality and eliminating racism, xenophobia and discrimination. If we are to truly address such issues and work together towards achieving the SDGs, we need to put aside the petty ethnicity associated with manipulative politics and look at what we, as the international community can realistically achieve, for the betterment of all of us.\nI will wind up by quoting the late President Mandela again, and I quote:\n\nSo, Mr. President, I call upon the international community to build into their own regimes, into their human rights plans, the indispensable must of deploring racism, xenophobia and discrimination of any kind.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "d37aca8b5fce3dd398dcd21e0a78df82"}

The mechanism and strategic plan the Government has currently deployed to respond to the pandemic while maintaining normalcy in the daily life, consist of 10 pillars: national level coordination, planning and review as the first pillar, raising awareness among the public about the risk and active participation of the society in the mitigation process as the second, supervision, rapid response and detection as the third, monitoring at the ports of entry and inland transportations routes as the fourth, strengthening the laboratory system as the fifth, control and prevention of the spread of the virus as the sixth, adequate handling of patients as the seventh, expediting facilities to all the healthcare services as the eighth, continuation of the essential health services as the ninth and ensuring social security and continuation of economic activities as the tenth.\n\nSri Lanka has a long history of successful vaccination programmes. When introducing the COVID-19 vaccination programme the Government ensures that public confidence is maintained. Sri Lanka is already included in the COVAX facility for COVID-19 vaccination. For the implementation of a more safe vaccine programme in liaison with the WHO, a Coordination Committee consisted of highest level experts at the Ministry of Health has been appointed. Following the discussions with WHO, UNICEF, ADB and World Bank the Government has been able to secure funds for improvement and procurement of equipments for the maintenance of vaccine cold-chains.\n\n\n\nAs we finally pass through this Pandemic, let us hope that in a post Pandemic era through coordinated and collective action aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, we may build an inclusive and more resilient post-COVID world which is fairer and greener.\nAyubowan!

The principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, must guide our search for solutions. The Clean Development Mechanism to reduce GHG emissions is imperative. Developed countries must implement their commitments to the developing, by providing financial support, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. All Parties to the Convention must expedite domestic preparations for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth, currently Chaired by Sri Lanka, has paid particular attention to incorporating the resilience of small states to climate change and natural disasters, and developing innovative proposals on Climate Finance. Attention has been focused on exploring the potential for simplified arrangements for access to climate funds for SIDS and LDCS. The Commonwealth calls for improved prospects for the developing countries to have access to existing funds.\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "d518883043833c51a099eb5a14d210d6"}

It carried a host of commitments that were not deliverable and were not in conformity with the Constitution of Sri Lanka. This led to the compromising of national security to a point of reviving terrorist acts on Easter Sunday 2019 causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\n\n\nWe have provided detailed updates to the OHCHR in December 2020 as well as in January 2021 on the progress of implementation of commitments that Sri Lanka had undertaken such as continuity of the existing mechanisms, appointment of a special commission of inquiry headed by a Supreme Court Judge, achieving the SDGs, progress made in returning lands, demining and creating new avenues of livelihoods.\n\n\n\nIt is regrettable that despite the spirit of cooperation with the HRC and its mechanisms, elements working against Sri Lanka intend to table another country-specific resolution based on this OHCHR Report. This rejected report by Sri Lanka has unjustifiably broadened its scope and mandate further, incorporating many issues of governance and matters that are essentially domestic in any self-respecting, sovereign country.\n\n\nI leave it to the members and observers of this Council to make their own judgment on whether Sri Lanka represents a situation that warrants the urgent attention of this Council, or if this campaign is essentially a political move that contravenes the very values and principles on which this Council has been established. Particularly at a time when legislation is enacted by some countries to protect their soldiers from prosecution in military operations carried out overseas, only points to duplicity and the hypocritical nature of their motives. This cannot but result in a significant loss of morale among countries engaged in the struggle against terrorism.\n\n\nThe Council must hold the scales even. Not going by hearsay, unilateral action or one angled doubtful sources but adhere to its guiding principles. Insistence on such ever-expanding externally driven prescriptions notwithstanding our continuous cooperation and engagement with this Council can pose numerous challenges.\n\n\nAs the Council is aware this is a critical time to the entire world in the last hundred years where we need to be united in our efforts to overcome the Covid19 pandemic and to revive battered economies. I appeal to the members of this Council to take note of our continued engagement and cooperation on its merit and support us by rejecting any resolution against Sri Lanka. We believe that the extent to which the resources and time of this Council has been utilized on Sri Lanka is unwarranted, and carries a discouraging message to the sovereign states of the global South.\n\n\nThe need of the hour, in the face of an unprecedented pandemic, is solidarity rather than rancor and acrimony arising from divisions within this council. In view of the circumstances set out above, we urge that this resolution be rejected by the Council and be brought to closure.\n\n\nMay I conclude quoting the words of Lord Buddha,\n\n\nMay all beings be safe,\nMay all beings be free from suffering.\nMay all beings be well and happy.\nThank you.\n..........................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "d77f6602af803b99ab7f9c6840a2a327"}

The importance of improving the resilience of maritime trade, increasing greater cooperation on climate change, and finally I would like to mention a few points on maritime crime.\n\nMaritime Trade\n\nClimate Change as a threat multiplier in the IOR\n\nMaritime Crime\n\nClosely connected with the rise of violent non-state actors is the growth in the drugs trade in the Indian Ocean. The growing number of drug seizures by various naval forces in the Indian Ocean indicate that criminal and terrorist networks continue to target the Indian Ocean as a trafficking network as a way for their products to reach Europe, and North America. The drugs trade can also no longer be isolated as an individual threat, as evidence suggests that many of the profits from such networks have proven to be funding terror networks from Afghanistan to Somalia. The effects the drug trade has on particularly economically vulnerable communities will place additional financial burdens on developing states, as they try to grapple with the most effective intervention strategies to combat the ensuing social ills of the drug on their societies. Sri Lanka with the help of UN agencies such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have stepped up our obligations and responsibilities in curtailing these activities.\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "d81468b8da703a53a076a4ef90a82205"}

The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to support the organization and believes that CICA would be able to offer the world many useful insights. The Minister also highlighted that all 27 Member States have robust institutions and sharing experiences and expertise would be an advantage as the world endeavors to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCooperation in the fields of infrastructure, education, vocational training, environmental issues, mitigating rural poverty, value-added exports and renewable energy are areas that CICA could vigorously pursue, stated the Foreign Minister. On the environmental front, he acknowledged that economic development at the cost of the environment is not sustainable and outlined the steps taken by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to promote a green economy with the shift from chemical based fertilizers to organic ones. Minister Peiris also reiterated that while it is important for countries to increase their GDP, it should be done in a manner that ensures equitable distribution and that the benefits trickle down to all communities, in particular the rural communities.\nExecutive Director Sarybay briefed the Minister on the activities of CICA and outlined its plans to establish a Council of Eminent Persons and the arrangements being made for the Ministerial meeting in October 2021.

{"title": "Address by H.E. Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka at the 73rd Session of the  United Nations General Assembly- 25 September 2018, New York", "date": "date", "content": "\n\n\n\nMay the Noble Triple Gem bless all of you !\nMr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nDistinguished Heads of State,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nFriends,\n\n\n\nWe, as Member States of the United Nations, must consider it as our duty and responsibility to comprehensively study and reflect upon the contemporary political developments, economic disparities, and common challenges faced by humanity.When speaking of international political developments and trends, we must in particular focus our attention on refugees that have become a global issue as there are a large number of refugees all over the world. Therefore, I believe that the efforts of the United Nations, its Member States and other organizations dealing with the issues related to refugees must be broader and more effective.\nSri Lanka is a country that follows moderate policies with regard to the exercise of its foreign policy. We are a senior member of the Non-Aligned Movement. The 1976 Non-Aligned Summit, which is considered one of the most successful, was held in Sri Lanka. Within the framework of non-alignment, we consider all nations of the world as friends. I am glad to note that Sri Lanka does not have adversaries in the contemporary world.\nWhen discussing international political issues, we must especially mention the issue of the Palestinian people. I believe that the United Nations and the world powers should approach this issue with greater understanding and attention. Successive governments in Sri Lanka have supported the liberation struggle of the Palestinian people. I believe that the United Nations and all Member States should adopt a more humane approach when advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people, and taking into account the inhumane conditions they face, approach this issue in a broader manner.\nWe all know that poverty is one of the fundamental problems affecting the world. I am of the view that the United Nations can do more to address the issue of poverty. We know that today, hundreds of millions of people across the world suffer from hunger. Climate change, income disparities, and certain shortcomings of governments to fulfill obligations towards their citizens, are among the key causes of poverty. The negative effects of climate change on economies have further exacerbated this problem. Therefore, it is essential to assist and support countries which are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. I must mention that just as poverty plays a central role in many problems that plague the world, trafficking in weapons, illicit drugs and narcotics have also become grave threats to humanity.\n\nWithin the framework of action of the United Nations, we must all work at national and international levels towards the implementation of the agreed outcomes of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, finalized under the guidance of the former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for the benefit of humanity as well as other living beings, our streams and rivers, and planet Earth as a whole. I must state that Sri Lanka, as a UN Member State, gives utmost priority to these endeavours.\n\nSri Lanka's security forces defeated one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world. As a result, Sri Lanka remains an undivided country that enjoys sustainable peace. Therefore, I must respectfully recall the yeoman service rendered by our security forces in defeating a dreaded terrorist organization, and I take this opportunity to thank our security forces for their great sacrifices in ushering peace and ensuring territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. At a time when almost ten years have passed since the end of the conflict, I call upon the international community to look at my country from a new perspective with new ideas. I call on you all to refresh your views on my noble motherland and assist us in our efforts towards achieving economic development, prosperity, and a secure future as a country at peace following a deadly conflict; as a country that is strengthening national reconciliation; as a country where national harmony prevails; as a country that has taken and continues to take every possible step to prevent recurrence of another conflict; and as a country that protects and upholds human rights.\nI respectfully request you to allow us the opportunity to resolve our own issues. The independence of a country is of paramount importance. I seek your support in our efforts, including in strengthening democracy and enhancing human development, while respecting our sovereignty. The sacrifices we have made and the initiatives we have taken in this regard are important for us in resolving our issues. As an independent country, we do not require foreign interference or threats. As a strong nation, we request all of you to allow us space to resolve our problems and to progress as an independent country. In this context, once again I wish to reiterate our request for your assistance and support for us to resolve our own issues as Sri Lankans. I further request your support in the efforts of my government to alleviate fear and suspicion among the communities living in our beloved motherland, and to build greater harmony.\nAs I stated before, it is imperative to accord priority to address the issues of people in Sri Lanka and the world over who are poverty-stricken. We must find solutions to their problems, taking into consideration the ideas and thoughts of the younger generation.\n\nThank you. May the Noble Triple Gem bless you.\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "db90499c2bb53c9882c0c9ba3b21c393"}

They chose a leader who would fulfil their aspirations of strong and independent democratic institutions, freedom of expression, the rule of law, good governance and the promotion and protection of human rights.\n\n\nWe have also initiated dialogues with diaspora groups and individuals with a view to working with them and obtaining their ideas, views, and assistance for the reconciliation process that is currently underway in the country including projects that directly relate to the welfare of the people.\nOn the international stage, Sri Lanka is once again working closely with the United Nations Organisation and its systems and procedures. We liaise closely with the High Commissioner for Human Rights and his office and we remain open to working with the OHCHR to obtain technical assistance to address several important issues including justice and accountability related issues. We have started working with the United Nations and its agencies to obtain financial and technical assistance for formulating resettlement plans, meeting the immediate requirements of those being resettled, training and capacity building.

We must change mindsets that have got used to thinking of who did what to whom at what time. We have to rise above hatred and feelings of vengeance.\n\nIn this journey, we require the help of our friends and well-wishers overseas. While acknowledging and thanking the government and people of Japan for their constant support and generosity for long years, we look forward to strengthening the partnership between our two nations further, and we hope that Japan will walk with us closely in this challenging yet rewarding journey of nation building that we have undertaken, to make Sri Lanka the paradise that it so deserves to be.\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "e8a08b526eaf3f21a5141674103cf9cb"}

Panjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs of Indonesia, UNDP and the AIS Secretariat for organizing this important event.\nAs you may be aware, Sri Lanka is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and is ranked sixth (6th) in the Climate Risk Index of 2020.\nLike other archipelagic and island countries, Sri Lanka is faced with climate induced disasters, biodiversity depletion, over exploitation, pollution, oil and chemical spillage, ocean acidification and sea-level rise. The continuation of COVID-19 pandemic has further escalated the impact of these calamities in multifold.\n\n\nBeing an active member of the Action Group on Mangrove Ecosystems and Livelihoods under the Commonwealth Blue Charter, Sri Lanka has taken considerable efforts to conserve the ecosystem, including the launch of the National Policy on Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Mangrove Ecosystems in September 2020.\n\nFurthermore, to reduce the impact of micro-plastic pollution, which also has contributed to the rapidly declining fish stocks, a high priority is therefore banning the use of single use plastics.\nHaving chaired the 13th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol, in 2001, I am happy to state that Sri Lanka is moving forward with the Colombo Declaration on Sustainable Nitrogen Management, with an ambition to halve Nitrogen waste, also to mitigate the harmful effects of algal bloom, ocean dead zones and eutrophication.\nSri Lanka welcomes the Manado Joint Declaration adopted at the 1st Ministerial Meeting of Archipelagic and Islands States Forum, and looks forward to future discussions of an ambitious Road Map to tackle ocean sustainability challenges through the implementation of policy and community level approaches, regionally and internationally.\nAyubowan\nThank you.\n\nThe full video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/5x5xUTQI-GM\n...................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/5x5xUTQI-GM\n..............................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/5x5xUTQI-GM\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "eb8bb3e9d0d3371d9d0fae5a5678689c"}

Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Foreign Relations of  Sri Lanka 26 February 2020", "date": "date", "content": "\n\n\n\nSri Lanka\n\n\nMadam President\nMadam High Commissioner\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n\n\nSri Lanka never had any illusion that the end of the conflict against the LTTE terrorists, will overnight convert to a lasting peace. Although Sri Lanka was not a case of nation building, like many conflict situations that this Council is dealing with, we were mindful that Sri Lanka needed certain reviews and strengthening of existing structures, as part of a sustainable peace and reconciliation programme.\n\nMadam President,\nAs at December 2014, at the point the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, of which I was a member, was concluding its term, we had made considerable progress in;\n\nde-mining\nresettlement\nreturn of land used by the security forces\nreduction of military presence in the former conflict areas,\nrehabilitation and reintegration of ex- LTTE combatants including child soldiers,\nrapid infrastructure development\nrestoration of the right to franchise in the former conflict affected areas, and\nestablishment of domestic mechanisms to address issues related to accountability, rule of law and human rights\n\n\nMadam President,\n\n\n\n- information presented before the UK House of Lords by Lord Naseby,\n\n- other reports from the UN and international agencies including the ICRC\n- as well as exposed diplomatic cables.\n\nProcedurally, in co-sponsoring Resolution 30/1, the previous Government violated all democratic principles of governance.\n\nit declared support for the resolution even before the draft text was presented\nit sought no Cabinet approval to bind the country to deliver on the dictates of an international body.\nthere was no reference to the Parliament on the process, undertakings and repercussions of such co-sponsorship.\nmore importantly the Resolution itself included provisions which are undeliverable due to its inherent illegality, being in violation of the constitution\n\nthe supreme law of the country.\n\nit also overruled the reservations expressed by professional diplomats, academia, media and the general public.\nthe then President Maithripala Sirisena also stated that he was not consulted on the matter at that time.\nIt remains to date a blot on the sovereignty and dignity of Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\nMost seriously, it is seen that the dictated changes in the country pursuant to 30/1, undermined the national interest and compromised national security, including weakening national intelligence operations and related safeguards, which are deemed to have contributed to the lapses that resulted in the Easter Sunday attacks in April 2019, which targeted churches and hotels, resulting in loss of life, including those of foreign nationals, which poses challenges to our government to restore national security.\nIt is ironic that, in March 2019, the previous government which co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 in October 2015, began the process of dismantling its dictates through the statement, made in this Council by my predecessor, which acknowledged the very real constraints that had been ignored 4 years before at the time of co-sponsoring this resolution. That statement sought to qualify the parameters of co-sponsorship of the Resolution. It questioned;\n\n\n\n\nMadam President,\nNotwithstanding withdrawing from co-sponsorship of this Resolution, Sri Lanka remains committed to achieving the goals set by the people of Sri Lanka on accountability and human rights, towards sustainable peace and reconciliation. To this end;\n\n\nThirdly, Sri Lanka will continue to remain engaged with, and seek as required, the assistance of the UN and its agencies including the regular human rights mandates/bodies and mechanisms in capacity building and technical assistance, in keeping with domestic priorities and policies.\nFinally, in conjunction with all members of the UN, Sri Lanka will seek to work towards the closure of the Resolution.\nMadam President,\n\n\nMay I conclude quoting the words of Lord Buddha,\n\nMay all beings be safe\nMay all beings be free from suffering,\nMay all beings be well and happy.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "ebaa7bec96e3312293a37f045c0ecf01"}

Members of the Maha Sangha,  Reverend Clergy of other faiths,  Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Speaker, Hon. Ministers and Members of Parliament, Hon. Governors,  Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, My Dear Friends,\nAs we celebrate this 67th anniversary of the dawn of Independence, after nearly two centuries as a nation subject to colonial rule, it is most fortunate that I am able to address you at this historic city of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, today.\nThis occasion is of special significance because we commemorate the dawn of freedom at a time coincident with the taking of clear and resolute steps to firmly establish democracy and good governance, the Rule of Law, and a truly meaningful parliamentary system; to establish a long lasting and stable structure of good governance in keeping with the mandate given by the people at the recent presidential election.\n \nVen. Members of the Maha Sangha,  Reverend Clergy of other faiths,  Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Speaker, Hon. Ministers and Members of Parliament, Hon. Governors,  Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, My Dear Friends,\nAs we celebrate this 67th anniversary of the dawn of Independence, after nearly two centuries as a nation subject to colonial rule, it is most fortunate that I am able to address you at this historic city of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, today.\nThis occasion is of special significance because we commemorate the dawn of freedom at a time coincident with the taking of clear and resolute steps to firmly establish democracy and good governance, the Rule of Law, and a truly meaningful parliamentary system; to establish a long lasting and stable structure of good governance in keeping with the mandate given by the people at the recent presidential election.\n  \nWe obtained independence on February 4th 1948 as a result of the struggle for freedom carried out through a long period by our patriotic and heroic leaders. In 1815, at the very time when subjugation began and freedom was being lost, the spirit of the struggle for freedom began when Kudhapola Thero brought down the British flag in Kandy. The armed struggle to defeat the foreign forces in our country carried out in the uprisings of 1818 and 1848 did not meet with success. Later, our struggle for freedom was transformed into a determined campaign of opposition to foreign rule, in keeping with our inherent cultural and social traditions of peaceful and determined protest. \nThe leaders of all communities in our country participated in discussions and negotiations with the colonial power, and by way of mass protests and strikes, obtained many rights our people were entitled to, but had been denied. All our people were united in these struggles. The names that stand out among those who participated and gave leadership to these struggles are the Anagarika Dharmapala, Sir D B Jayatilleke, F R Senanayake, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, Ponnambalam Ramanadan, T B Jayah, N M Perera, Philip Gunewardene, S A Wickramasinghe, Walisinghe Harischandra, and D S Senanayake.  We must also remember the immense contribution made by writers and poets such as Munidasa Cumaranatunga, Piyadasa Sirisena and other exceptional campaigners for freedom through writing, who used their pens to effectively kindle the spirit of freedom in the hearts and minds of people.\nIn 1956, eight years after the winning of independence, the late Prime Minister Mr. S W R D Bandaranaike gave more reality to freedom with the closing down of the British Air Force and Naval Bases at Katunayake and Trincomalee. The sovereignty of our country that remained symbolic under the British crown, even after Independence, was transformed into genuine sovereignty with the establishment of the sovereign Republic of Sri Lanka on May 22nd 1972, under the leadership of Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. It is the expectation of our government to give due recognition to Republic Day in our country, as it is celebrated as the National Day in many other democratic countries. \nThe light of freedom, which remained covered under the shadow of terrorism, began to shine again after the eradication of the brutality of terrorism by the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the Year 2009. Although our sovereignty and territorial integrity was retained by this, the need to proceed further towards national unity through genuine amity and friendship among people is a task that needs achievement. Just as the land was united, it remains necessary to join all Sri Lankans with the bonds of unity. \nAs we celebrate the gaining of Independence, today, we recognize our bounden duty to give all honour and respect to the members of the Security Forces who made great sacrifices to protect our sovereignty and territorial integrity in the battle against terrorism.  Similarly, we must also remember with due honour and respect those from all ethnicities, religions and ideologies who participated with militancy and gave leadership in the long struggle for freedom from colonial rule.\nOur government that gives the highest priority to national security, is keenly interested in going beyond the prevailing policies and programmes in this regard, to make a comprehensive study of all aspects of national security and work on proposals and directions to bring about a truly sustainable policy in this important aspect of governance.  This Independence Commemoration is also an opportunity for us to make a careful analysis of decisions taken by us in the nearly seven decades that have gone by since independence was won. We were unable to fully enjoy the fruits of freedom because, under the neo-colonial economic pattern that prevailed as the vestige of colonialism, where disputes among the haves and have-nots grew sharper, while those who lived below the poverty line grew larger, and consequently ethnic disputes and inequalities emerged. Therefore, it is now the time to move away from the mutual heaping of blame on each other, and instead, in the cause of humanity, respect one and other for the progress of the nation.\n\nThe first and principle challenge before us today is that of making our freedom more meaningful,  by ensuring the necessary changes required in the political, economic, social and cultural norms that prevail in our country. In keeping with the mandate given by the people for a clear and definite change, at a time when political violence had raised its head and there was absence of the Rule of Law, what is essential for us today is politics and governance that will ensure co-existence and reconciliation towards national understanding to build a humanitarian society.\nOn this historic occasion, I once again extend a respectful invitation to all political parties represented in Parliament, to join us in establishing an All Party National Government, to carry on the task of ensuring freedom and democracy, with good governance strengthened by strong ethics, encouraging the growth of spiritual values, and eliminating poverty from our midst.\nThe aim of our government is the building of the widest friendships internationally that recognizes and respects our individuality as a nation. It remains our policy, in keeping with the principles of Non-Alignment to, extend friendship to all nations, and strengthen friendship and cooperation with international organizations to achieve greater mutual understanding. It is the expectation of our Government to obtain the assistance of friendly nations and international organizations to advance the development of our Motherland and assure the future success of our people.\nWe understand that our people will be able to achieve the full benefits of freedom only after their living standards are raised to a level of satisfaction. It is essential to take speedy steps to eradicate poverty because, as long as any segment of our society suffers in poverty, it is not in keeping with our conscience to make loud boasts about freedom. The highest priority of this government is to bring down the current level of poverty that stands at 6.7% within the shortest possible period.\nAs a country with a largely agricultural economy we can ensure sustainable development by strengthening this agro-based economy. Our Government is committed to raise national agricultural standards by providing scientific knowledge from the advances in the new technological world, the use of new products and innovations to further advance agriculture, and through our inherent traditions of progress take our national economy to greater heights of success and modernity. Similarly, the government is also determined to introduce wide and suitable industrialization through encouragement and incentives for local and foreign investment in industry, most suitable to our needs and resources.\n\nOur Government is also taking action to build a society that respects ethical principles, and takes all necessary steps to completely eradicate the massive corruption, fraud and wrongful action in development projects, and thus make the freedom of our country and people truly meaningful. I wish to emphasize that it has been possible to move forward with determination to achieve the above objectives because of the mandate given to me by the people of our country in the recent Presidential election .\nOn this commemoration of independence, let us make a joint commitment to provide a truly good, ethical, virtuous, wise and fair service to all, living in brotherhood and reconciliation, and thus raise our country and State to one that is second to none other in this world.  It is our national duty to etch in the minds of our children the pride we have in the freedom we have won. Apart from the great literary writers I mentioned earlier, thinking of our children I now recall the words with which the Tibetan monk S Mahinda Thera instilled the feelings of patriotism among our people directing his words at our children.\nAs he said it:\n\nMay you be blessed by the Noble Tripple Gem.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "ec6993c0aa9d34119a170e0d549f7d3e"}

We can learn from other experiences, but our own path to reconciliation will be primarily driven by the domestic context in which we function underpinning the primacy of state obligations;\n\nIn the area of Truth Seeking, the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) established by law is being fully operationalized with necessary allocation of resources while the Cabinet of Ministers is currently considering draft legislation to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\nIn the area of Justice, review of cases under the PTA have taken place and trials under the PTA have been expedited, while consultations are ongoing in Parliament to replace the PTA with proposed legislation for counter terrorism ensuring its conformity with international standards and best practices.\nAs for Reparations, an Office for Reparations has been established by law, three Commissioners have been recommended for appointment by the Constitutional Council and in the 2019 Budget, the Government has allocated Rs. 500 million to pay a monthly allowance to the families of disappeared persons, who have already received a certificate of absence.\nTo ensure Non-recurrence of conflict, we are firmly resolved to fulfilling the agenda on reconciliation.\n\nMadam High Commissioner,\n\n\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka at the highest political levels, has both publicly and in discussions with the present and former High Commissioners for Human Rights and other interlocutors, explained the constitutional and legal challenges that precludes it from including non-citizens in its judicial processes. It has been explained that if non-citizen judges are to be appointed in such a process, it will not be possible without an amendment to the Constitution by 2/3 of members of the Parliament voting in favour and also the approval of the people at a Referendum.\nMindful of the time constraint, I wish to table for record, my full statement which provides a detail response to the OHCHR report with reference to the relevant paragraphs therein.\nMadam High Commissioner,\nAt a time when the world is confronted with increasing acts of terrorism and violent extremism, as I stated before this Council last year, the action by the Sri Lankan security forces during the conflict was against a group designated as a terrorist organization by many countries, and not against any community. Further, it must be asserted that there are no proven allegations against individuals on war crimes or crimes against humanity in the OISL report of 2015 or in any subsequent official document. It is an injustice to deprive any serving or retired officer of the Sri Lankan security forces or the police of their rights.\n\nMadam High Commissioner,\n\nOn behalf of the Government, I reiterate that Sri Lanka, based on the above parameters, will continue to work with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and other partners.\nI thank you.\n[1]https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2017-10-12/debates/14CAA83D-8895-4182-8C4F-D964E0A5B399/SriLanka;\nhttps://parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/report-of-paranagama.pdf\nhttp://margastorehouse.org/The%20Last%20Stages%20of%20the%20war%20in%20Sri%20Lanka.pdf;\n\n.........................................................................\n\n(Full Version)\n\nMr. President,\nMadam High Commissioner/Deputy High Commissioner,\nMembers of the Council and Delegates to the 40th Session of HRC,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\n\n\nMadam High Commissioner,\nAt the outset we thank you for the acknowledgement throughout your report of the open, constructive and cooperative approach adopted by the Government of Sri Lanka, towards all stakeholders, both within and outside the country, and with the processes and mechanisms of this Council. Our intention has been to engage comprehensively so that our deep-rooted commitment to achieving reconciliation is made evident. Sri Lanka remains committed to achieving reconciliation and has made steady progress in pursuit of that objective. We have reported to this Council at consecutive sessions on the substantial progress made among others, with regard to civil and political rights, including advances with respect to freedom of expression and assembly, civil society consultation, establishment of a robust right to information framework, the strengthening of independent commissions, including the Human Rights Commission, among others.\n\nIn the area of Truth Seeking, an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has been established by law and fully operationalised. The Cabinet of Ministers is currently considering draft legislation to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In the area of Justice review of cases under the PTA have taken place and trials under the PTA have been expedited, while consultations are ongoing in Parliament to replace the PTA with proposed legislation for Counter Terrorism (CTA) ensuring its conformity to international standards and best practices. As for Reparations, the Office for Reparations Act passed by Parliament in October 2018 has provided for the establishment of an Office of Reparations in terms of the said law and three Commissioners have been recommended for appointment by the Constitutional Council. These institutions are empowered to look into, ascertain, acknowledge and address complaints made to the same. It must be noted that statutory duties performed by such bodies have to accord with a process of fairness and rules of natural justice, in achieving the objectives in respect to which such bodies are established. To ensure Non-recurrence of conflict, we are firmly resolved to fulfilling the agenda on reconciliation.\n\n\nIn the context of paragraph 15, the institutions already established to take the transitional justice measures forward would require that they adhere to the rule of law, and the results of the work carried out by such institutions should be able to withstand the test of any potential judicial process. Thus, while appreciating the acknowledgment in the report that steps have been taken for institution building, it may be recalled that the benefits arising from the functions of such institutions that accrue to individual rights holders should accord with the principles of natural justice as decisions made in haste compromise on principles of natural justice.\n\nIn the context of paragraph 19, it may be noted that under the Reparations Act which was passed into law in October 2018, three Commissioners have been recommended for appointment by the Constitutional Council and in the 2019 Budget, the Government has allocated Rs. 500 million to pay a monthly allowance for families of disappeared persons who have received the certificate of absence.\nWith reference to paragraph 23 of the Report with regard to the discovery of human skeletal remains in Mannar on 29th May 2018, this matter is a case in point for the need to exercise caution in approaching issues of this nature. Contrary to pre-conceived notions, it was scientifically established that the recovered skeletal remains had no nexus to the conflict. Having been facilitated through the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), the test results obtained from a USA laboratory have revealed that the said skeletal remains date back to 1499-1719 AD - a period when Sri Lanka was largely under European colonial rule. This is yet another instance that demonstrates that allegations and mere collection of data should not be pre-judged to cast unjustified aspersions. It also amply demonstrates the need for allegations to always be subject to the due process of investigation in accordance with established legal procedures and not be hastily credited to support unfounded assumptions.\n\nMadam High Commissioner,\n\n\nFurther, it must be asserted that there are no proven allegations against individuals on war crimes or crimes against humanity in the OISL report of 2015 or in any subsequent official document. It is an injustice to deprive any serving or retired officer of the Sri Lankan security forces or the police their due rights.\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka believes that it is indeed erroneous that more attention has not been paid to the above mentioned information, by agencies including the OHCHR, which is required to seek the truth.\nWith reference to paragraph 31, it must be noted that constitutional reform is a continuing process conducted in accordance with the procedures of Parliament, which has moved forward unimpeded notwithstanding other political developments in the country. This process requires addressing all issues relevant to the diverse populace of Sri Lanka and is necessarily embarked upon taking cognizance of the concerns of all stakeholders.\nMadam High Commissioner,\n\nWith reference to the paragraph 35, Sri Lanka appreciates the recognition by the Council of the considerable efforts taken by GOSL in releasing lands held by the security forces.\n\n\nOf the 71,172.56 acres of State lands held by the Security Forces, since May 2009, 63,257.48 acres have been released, as at 12th March 2019, i.e. a release of 88.87% of land originally held.\n\n\nOf the 28,215.29 acres of the private land held by the Security Forces since May 2009, 26,005.17 acres (92.16%) have been released as at 12th\n\nThese significant figures highlight the utmost priority accorded by the Government to the incremental and expeditious release of lands held by the security forces.\nHowever, the remaining lands, which are a necessity in the context of national security, would continue to be held by the security forces, with compensation being paid in respect of privately owned lands.\n\n\nOther infrastructure development projects that have taken place since 2015 - 2018 are as follows:\n\nThe above represent only a few of the many development projects launched by the Government of Sri Lanka for the economic well-being of the people of the Northern and Eastern Provinces.\nWith reference to the concern raised on the alleged destruction of property before return, it needs to be categorically stated that there is no such government policy. On the contrary, the security forces have dismantled military infrastructure before the handover in the interest of the safety and facilitation for civilians.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, as stated earlier, when evidence surfaces, which contests the culpability of the Sri Lankan security forces and police in having deliberately caused civilian casualties during the last phase of the conflict, this evidence is summarily disregarded.\nMadam High Commissioner,\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka at the highest political levels, has both publicly and in discussions with the present and former High Commissioner for Human Rights and other interlocutors, explained the constitutional and legal challenges that preclude it from including non-citizens in its judicial processes. It has been explained that if non-citizen judges are to be appointed in such a process, it will not be possible without an amendment to the Constitution by 2/3 of members of the Parliament voting in favour and also the approval of the people at a referendum.\n\n\nMadam High Commissioner,\nIn developing these transitional justice mechanisms, Sri Lanka does not believe there is justification for the setting up of an Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka.\nThis said we welcome the benefit extended by the expertise and support of the UN and OHCHR, and in particular technical assistance from the technical advisers of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence. We also appreciate the understanding shown and the technical and financial assistance offered by other bilateral and multilateral partners. We would also welcome further capacity building, particularly training for judicial, prosecutorial, and investigation officers, in enhancing specialized skills in their respective areas and further improving the functions and credibility of the ongoing local processes.\nThe Government of Sri Lanka looks forward to continuing our engagement with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Human Rights mechanisms and procedures, and working in close cooperation with the international community in our journey towards achieving civil, political as well as socio-economic and cultural rights, and consolidating durable peace and reconciliation for our people.\nI thank you.\n\n[1]https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2017-10-12/debates/14CAA83D-8895-4182-8C4F-D964E0A5B399/SriLanka;\nhttps://parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/report-of-paranagama.pdf\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "edb7d4a659b3314d9c05b057b858601f"}

Minister Qureshi commended the Sri Lankan government of its efforts in eradicating terrorism and defeating the LTTE and thereby restoring peace in the region which was of vital importance.\nThe Minister emphasized that the two countries having held longstanding trade ties need to reach a higher level of economic cooperation, which at present has not been fully optimised and there is much potential for economic linkages to be strengthened. He highlighted that Sri Lanka is presently not fully utilizing its credit line of USD 200 million with Pakistan and invited Sri Lanka to make use of the opportunity, especially in the animal husbandry area, which would be beneficial for the country. The Minister also informed that both countries must look towards strengthening the Pakistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSLFTA) which was the first bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) of Pakistan.\nHe requested the Foreign Ministry to identify potential areas of trade and investment and plan a programme which would introduce the Sri Lankan business sector to visit Pakistan and form linkages with suitable counterparts in Pakistan.

These recommendations are based on ill-founded allegations.\n\nThe call for asset freezes, travel bans, references to the ICC and the exercise of universal jurisdiction by individual States, based on evidence that up to date has been denied access to and retained by the High Commissioners Office with some of it unreleased for thirty years, particularly in relation to a country like Sri Lanka which has consistently and constructively engaged with the UN and its mechanisms, points to a distinct and eminent danger which the international community as a whole need to take note of. Such unilateral actions by certain countries are unacceptable and a violation of the principles of natural justice.\n\n\nMadam President,\nInsistence on ever-expanding externally driven prescriptions, notwithstanding our continuous cooperation and engagement with this Council and all UN bodies, can pose numerous challenges and such processes could set a dangerous precedent affecting all member states of the UN.\nWe regret the disproportionate attention drawn to Sri Lanka by this Council, driven by political motivations.

Gen. Shavendra Silva as the Army Commander in the context that there were no factually substantiated or proven allegations of human rights violations against him, and by virtue of his being Chief of Staff at the time.\n\nHe said none of these reports can be taken as substantive as establishing culpability of Lt. Gen. Silva.\nThe Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) as well as the Paranagama Commission reports, which were domestic processes that examined the allegations particularly with regard to the last stages of the conflict, have not found substantive evidence against the conduct of the current Army Commander, who has testified in person before both Commissions.\nThe Foreign Secretary noted that in relation to this issue Sri Lanka was of the view that there have also been serious discrepancies in the information released to the public domain by the UN. There was no reference to the delay in the joint National Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (NHRCSL) and UN vetting of peace keepers, which had been alluded to when the discussion of limiting Peacekeepers was initially conveyed to the Government of Sri Lanka. It was pointed out that while the MoU with the UNDPO clearly states that modalities for termination shall be agreed to following consultations between the parties, in this instance, the UN did not fulfill its obligation and took an unilateral decision and presented a fait accompli to Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the communications on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka with the UNDPO it has been pointed out that the appointment of Lt. Gen. Silva as the Army Commander has no link to the suitability and engagement of the Army personnel being nominated for UN Peacekeeping operations who are thoroughly, jointly vetted, and therefore it is unacceptable to penalize these troops through punitive action on them personally. Furthermore, depriving them of being legitimately deployed in the related operations earmarked following their training and equipping, would also be a denial of their rightful expectation. Thereby, the UN has overlooked the humanitarian aspect by implementing the said decision. In addition, to these identified Sri Lankan Peacekeepers being denied the opportunity of providing their competent expertise due to the said action by the UNDPO, it would also result in inconveniencing the troop receiving country and possible destabilization and compromising of peacekeeping operations in the relevant theatre of service.\n\nOn behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, Foreign Secretary Aryasinha requested that the UNDPO reviews its decision in the context of the facts presented by the Government of Sri Lanka, thereby, being respectful of a country that has been a long standing contributor to UN Peacekeeping since 1960, and continues to serve in some of the most difficult theatres of action, having also suffered casualties.\nAmbassador Kshenuka Senewiratne, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations, Brig. Vijendralal Gunathilleka, Military Advisor of the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the UN and other senior officials were associated with the Foreign Secretary. The Under Secretary General was assisted by Lt. Gen. Carlos Humberto Loitey, UN Military Adviser for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Peter Due, Representative of the Secretary General and Head of the UN Office in Belgrade (UNOB) and Mr. Marco Bianchini, Chief of the Front Office of the USG.\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nColombo\n\n28 September 2019\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "f309c2c845a737b6819bb42ad80a4ce0"}

Peiris concluded a successful, two- day official visit to India from 06-08 February 2022. The Foreign Minister undertook his maiden visit to New Delhi after assuming office as the Foreign Minister in August last year, on an invitation extended by the External Affairs Minister of India Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\nDuring the visit, Foreign Minister Peiris met with his counterpart Dr. Jaishankar and the National Security Advisor of India Shri Ajit Doval. Indian Foreign Secretary Shri Harsh Vardhan Shringla also called on the Foreign Minister.\nThe meeting between the two Ministers, followed by delegation level talks was held on 07 February at the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi. During the meeting, Minister Peiris thanked the External Affairs Minister of India for the invitation and the warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation.\nObserving that the relationship between India and Sri Lanka has evolved from a transactional relationship into a strategic partnership, Foreign Minister Peiris stated that it is increasingly recognized by the people of Sri Lanka that India is a true friend whom Sri Lanka can rely on at all times. In this context, Minister Peiris appreciated the financial assistance that the Government of India has extended to Sri Lanka to the tune of 2.4 billion USD at this critical juncture. Minister Jaishankar assured that the long-standing friendship between the two countries will always be a source of support to Sri Lanka.\nThe bilateral talks focussed on a wide range of matters of mutual interest, which included economic cooperation, power and energy cooperation, connectivity, people to people contact etc. Particular attention was drawn to the energy security of Sri Lanka, and referring to the recently inked Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm agreement, Foreign Minister Peiris stated that it signals a closer integration between the two countries, resulting in substantial benefits; a win-win situation for both. The prospects for renewable energy cooperation, particularly in wind and solar power sectors were also discussed at the talks.\nFocussing on the economic development in Sri Lanka, the discussion centred on the potential for Indian investments in priority sectors such as pharmaceuticals, food processing and manufacturing for which Minister Peiris invited Indian investments. The ways and means to harness the growing Indian outward tourism to revive the tourism industry in Sri Lanka, were also discussed.\nWith a view to maintaining the momentum of the trajectory of the Indo- Sri Lanka relationship, the Ministers agreed on the early finalization of several agreements and MoUs in the areas of defence, culture and education, that are pending between the two countries.\nDuring the talks, Foreign Minister Peiris also raised the fisheries issue with the Indian External Affairs Minister. Terming it as a 'flashpoint', the Foreign Minister pointed out that it has become a recurring issue, assuming a different complexion. The two sides agreed on the urgent need to convene all bilateral mechanisms in this regard.\n\n\nThe Foreign Minister, during his visit to New Delhi, had a number of interactions with prominent Indian print and electronic media as well.\nForeign Minister Prof. G.L.

We have consistently highlighted that the content of the resolution, its operative paragraph 06 in particular, violates the sovereignty of the people of Sri Lanka and the principles of the UN Charter. Once again, we are compelled to categorically reject any follow-up measures to the resolution, as well as the related recommendations and conclusions by the High Commissioner.\nMr. President,\n\n\nMr. President,\n\nThe Government would endeavour to establish a credible truth-seeking mechanism within the framework of the Constitution. The contours of such a model that would suit the particular conditions of Sri Lanka are under discussion.\n\nAs we delivered on the onerous task of review and reform of the PTA this year, to further enhance human rights, we will replace the PTA with a more comprehensive national security legislation in accordance with international best practices.\nThe recent delisting of groups and individuals will provide further impetus for constructive dialogue.\nThe independent statutory bodies established to advance the rights of victims and their families, and to provide reparations, continue to vigourously execute their respective mandates.\nThe Office on Missing Persons (OMP) has commenced the process of inquiry and verification, set up separate units on Tracing and Victim and Family Support, and acts as an Observer on relevant judicial proceedings.\nDespite economic constraints, the Office for Reparations (OR) continues to deliver on its mandate, and the recently adopted National Reparations Policy and Guidelines have expanded the work of the Office beyond monetary compensation, to other forms of support.\nThe necessary support and resources to strengthen the functioning of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), continue to be provided.\nThe outreach to overseas Sri Lankans encompassing all communities and generations will be expanded through the establishment of an Office for Overseas Sri Lankans, thus facilitating more vigourous engagement.\nMr. President,\nAs recognized in the Universal Declaration, human rights are interdependent, interrelated and indivisible. In upholding human rights, we have benefitted from the considerable expertise available with other countries as well as the United Nations. We will seek further advice and support on best practices as we proceed, and as deemed necessary.\n\nWe have facilitated two visits by the Office of the High Commissioner to Sri Lanka in May and August this year, and provided unimpeded access. The visits provided the officials of the OHCHR with the opportunity to engage with a range of stakeholders, and witness progress.\nMr. President,\nIt is 13 years since the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and since then a new generation has emerged with their own aspirations. While issues of reconciliation and accountability are being comprehensively addressed through a domestic process, it is time to reflect realistically on the trajectory of this resolution which has continued on the agenda of the Council for over a decade, and undertake a realistic assessment on whether it has benefited the people of Sri Lanka. There is a need to acknowledge actual progress on the ground and support Sri Lanka.\n\nMr. President,\n\nThank you.\n........................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.............................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "f66fa4b6d44a30228a0a9b69d1103140"}

The advanced unedited report of the Special Rapporteur (SR) was shared with Sri Lanka, for comments, on 3 February 2020, with a deadline of 28 February 2020, i.e. last Friday, leading to an Interactive Dialogue thereon today - Monday.\n\n\nThe people of Sri Lanka have lived amicably despite racial and religious differences for centuries, and continue to do so. Having suffered the scourge of separatist terrorism for nearly three-decades, they had been enjoying their hard-won peace and freedom, and had embarked on the path of reconciliation and national healing over the last decade. However, the Easter Sunday attacks reminded us that we are fighting a common adversary in terrorism, radicalization and extremism, which is a global threat.\n\nThe incidents of mob violence that occurred 3 weeks after the terrorist attacks were not communally motivated but caused by unruly elements. These mobs were efficaciously neutralised by the Government through a number of arrests and by bringing to justice alleged perpetrators. The country fast returned to normalcy, reassuring the safety and security of all Sri Lankans and visitors to the country. Through giving effect to relevant legal provisions and following necessary legal processes, order and rule of law has been firmly re-established. The security forces of Sri Lanka merit particular commendation for their prompt and professional action in this regard.\n\nIt is also regrettable that the report has sought to portray instances where criminal investigations have been conducted to prevent acts of terrorism in accordance with the law, as an endeavor to violate the freedom of religion or belief.\n\n\n\n\nThe report has failed to adequately discuss the drivers and root causes of radicalization of youth from one particular religious community to the extent of engaging in acts of terrorism, and appears to lack inputs from a broader spectrum of Sri Lankan society, including family members of victims and suspects, as well as other neutral groups. In describing attacks against and desecration of places of worship, the report has failed to refer to incidents of attacks on and vandalizing of Buddhist places of worship and instances of obstruction of Buddhist devotes in certain areas of the country.\nThe report also fails to adequately address positive measures undertaken by the Government and the law enforcement agencies to foster religious harmony, such as addressing extremist elements on all sides, payment of compensation through the Office for Reparations to victims of violence, and setting up of mechanisms such as an Inter-Religious Council. It is unfortunate that the resilience and solidarity of Sri Lankans protecting and assisting fellow citizens of all faiths in the aftermath of April 21, as demonstrated by Buddhists and Christians guarding Muslims at prayer, renovation of damaged property and restoration of damaged churches by the security forces, have not been reflected in the report. Nor has the laudable role played by the independent institutions of Sri Lanka, such as the Human Rights Commission, during this challenging period, received the attention that it warrants.\n\n\nWe look forward to continuing to engage with the Special Rapporteur and this Council in a constructive and meaningful manner towards this end.\nThank you\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "f6ccb65593bd37bd9b45366230e635d3"}

This virus transcends national boundaries and no Member State can withstand the varied effects of the pandemic nor find solutions alone. The UN plays an important role in fostering multilateral action and mobilizing global solidarity towards addressing this scourge. Sri Lanka appreciates and supports the contributions by the UN and especially the WHO to the global response to address the multiple challenges of the pandemic.\n\nHistorically, Sri Lanka has been closely associated with many of the important discourses in the UN. Sri Lanka served as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 1960 and as the President of the General Assembly in 1976.\nAs one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and as a key member of the Group of 77, Sri Lanka has continued to play a significant role in multilateral deliberations at the UN, particularly representing the interests of the global South. Some of the landmark contributions by Sri Lanka in the UN system include:\n- Leading the negotiations on the Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which has provided the foundation for a rules-based order for the oceans for over 30 years;\n- Initiating the UN General Assembly Resolution which unanimously declared Vesak, the most sacred day in the Buddhist calendar, as a United Nations Observance Day;\n- Serving the organisation through high-level professionals, such as the Under-Secretary General for Disarmament Affairs the UN and Secretary General of the UNCTAD.\n\n\n\n\nAs His Excellency the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa mentioned in his address to the High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly to commemorate the 75th Anniversary, Sri Lanka is hopeful that we of the United Nations would rededicate ourselves in efforts to strengthen this great institution to ensure the future we want.\nExcellencies,\nI also take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the UN family at large and in particular the UN staff in Colombo for their commitment and dedicated work.\nThank you.\n\n...........................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n........................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "f7310c9bf8aa3cc5964e86c21452e512"}

Mohan Peiris,\nPermanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations\nFriday, 29 January 2021\nMr. Chairman,\n\n\nMr. Chairman,\nThe irony is that the world does not place a high value on children, particularly in the context of armed conflict. It is a matter of record that 415 million children live in conflict affected areas. In high intensity conflict areas it is a staggering 149 million, which is double the number of children in the United States.\nMr. Chairman,\nHaving said that I wish to thank the Permanent Missions of Russia and Kazakhstan and the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children & Armed Conflict for organizing this discussion on a very important topic, a sad topic really. I also thank Mr. Voronkov, Under-Secretary-General for Counter-Terrorism and other briefers for their soul searching and insightful presentations.\n\nMr. Chairman,\nSadly, as most of us present today would know, my country Sri Lanka experienced the phenomenon of child soldiers at the hands of a group of non-state actors. This group used intimidation and terror tactics to pressurize families of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka to give their sons and daughters for their military purposes. When families refused, the children were\nabducted from schools or taken forcibly from their homes. Parents who resisted such recruitment faced violence, detention and even death. We are all too aware of what happens to children in the hands of such groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Chair,\nSri Lanka will continue to look after our own children and ensure that everyone will have a success story to tell and I wish that the other children suffering in the rest of the world would someday be emancipated from these miseries and would be free to live as members of a happy human family.\nThank you.\n............................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.....................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "fff3d3e9940b336d9706731cf78f6af0"}
